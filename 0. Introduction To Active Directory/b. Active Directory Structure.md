A directory service, such as [Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview) gives an organization ways to store directory data and make it available to both standard users and administrators on the same network. AD DS stores information such as usernames and passwords and manages the rights needed for authorized users to access this information.
AD is essentially a large database accessible to all users within the domain, regardless of their privilege level. A basic AD user account with no added privileges can be used to enumerate the majority of objects contained within AD, including but not limited to:

| Domain Computers         | Domain Users                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Domain Group Information | Organizational Units (OUs)  |
| Default Domain Policy    | Functional Domain Levels    |
| Password Policy          | Group Policy Objects (GPOs) |
| Domain Trusts            | Access Control Lists (ACLs) |
Active Directory is arranged in a hierarchical tree structure, with a forest at the top containing one or more domains, which can themselves have nested subdomains. A forest is the security boundary within which all objects are under administrative control. A forest may contain multiple domains, and a domain may include further child or sub-domains. A domain is a structure within which contained objects (users, computers, and groups) are accessible. It has many built-in Organizational Units (OUs), such as `Domain Controllers`, `Users`, `Computers`, and new OUs can be created as required.

At a very (simplistic) high level, an AD structure may look as follows:
```AD
INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/
├── ADMIN.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
│   ├── GPOs
│   └── OU
│       └── EMPLOYEES
│           ├── COMPUTERS
│           │   └── FILE01
│           ├── GROUPS
│           │   └── HQ Staff
│           └── USERS
│               └── barbara.jones
├── CORP.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
└── DEV.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```
Here we could say that `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` is the root domain and contains the subdomains (either child or tree root domains) `ADMIN.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`, `CORP.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`, and `DEV.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` as well as the other objects that make up a domain such as users, groups, computers, and more as we will see in detail below.

The graphic below shows two forests, `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` and `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL`. The two-way arrow represents a bidirectional trust between the two forests, meaning that users in `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` can access resources in `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` and vice versa. We can also see multiple child domains under each root domain. In this example, we can see that the root domain trusts each of the child domains, but the child domains in forest A do not necessarily have trusts established with the child domains in forest B. This means that a user that is part of `admin.dev.freightlogistics.local` would NOT be able to authenticate to machines in the `wh.corp.inlanefreight.local` domain by default even though a bidirectional trust exists between the top-level `inlanefreight.local` and `freightlogistics.local` domains. To allow direct communication from `admin.dev.freightlogistics.local` and `wh.corp.inlanefreight.local`, another trust would need to be set up.
