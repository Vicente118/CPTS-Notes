Aside from Kerberos and LDAP, Active Directory uses several other authentication methods which can be used (and abused) by applications and services in AD. These include LM, NTLM, NTLMv1, and NTLMv2. LM and NTLM here are the hash names, and NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 are authentication protocols that utilize the LM or NT hash

## LM
`LAN Manager` (LM or LANMAN) hashes are the oldest password storage mechanism used by the Windows operating system. LM debuted in 1987 on the OS/2 operating system. If in use, they are stored in the SAM database on a Windows host and the NTDS.DIT database on a Domain Controller. Due to significant security weaknesses in the hashing algorithm used for LM hashes, it has been turned off by default since Windows Vista/Server 2008. However, it is still common to encounter, especially in large environments where older systems are still used. Passwords using LM are limited to a maximum of `14` characters. Passwords are not case sensitive and are converted to uppercase before generating the hashed value, limiting the keyspace to a total of 69 characters making it relatively easy to crack these hashes using a tool such as Hashcat.

## NTHash (NTLM)
`NT LAN Manager` (NTLM) hashes are used on modern Windows systems. It is a challenge-response authentication protocol and uses three messages to authenticate: a client first sends a `NEGOTIATE_MESSAGE` to the server, whose response is a `CHALLENGE_MESSAGE` to verify the client's identity. Lastly, the client responds with an `AUTHENTICATE_MESSAGE`. These hashes are stored locally in the SAM database or the NTDS.DIT database file on a Domain Controller. The protocol has two hashed password values to choose from to perform authentication: the LM hash (as discussed above) and the NT hash, which is the MD4 hash of the little-endian UTF-16 value of the password. The algorithm can be visualized as: `MD4(UTF-16-LE(password))`.
#### NTLM Authentication Request

Even though they are considerably stronger than LM hashes (supporting the entire Unicode character set of 65,536 characters), they can still be brute-forced offline relatively quickly using a tool such as Hashcat. GPU attacks have shown that the entire NTLM 8 character keyspace can be brute-forced in under `3 hours`. Longer NTLM hashes can be more challenging to crack depending on the password chosen, and even long passwords (15+ characters) can be cracked using an offline dictionary attack combined with rules. NTLM is also vulnerable to the pass-the-hash attack, which means an attacker can use just the NTLM hash (after obtaining via another successful attack) to authenticate to target systems where the user is a local admin without needing to know the cleartext value of the password.
An NT hash takes the form of `b4b9b02e6f09a9bd760f388b67351e2b`, which is the second half of the full NTLM hash. An NTLM hash looks like this:
```shell
Rachel:500:aad3c435b514a4eeaad3b935b51304fe:e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2:::
```
Looking at the hash above, we can break the NTLM hash down into its individual parts:
- `Rachel` is the username
- `500` is the Relative Identifier (RID). 500 is the known RID for the `administrator` account
- `aad3c435b514a4eeaad3b935b51304fe` is the LM hash and, if LM hashes are disabled on the system, can not be used for anything
- `e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2` is the NT hash. This hash can either be cracked offline to reveal the cleartext value (depending on the length/strength of the password) or used for a pass-the-hash attack. Below is an example of a successful pass-the-hash attack using the [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) tool:
```shell
> crackmapexec smb 10.129.41.19 -u rachel -H e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2

SMB         10.129.43.9     445    DC01      [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 (name:DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.129.43.9     445    DC01      [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\rachel:e46b9e548fa0d122de7f59fb6d48eaa2 (Pwn3d!)
```
Now that we understand the capabilities and structure of NTLM let's examine the progression of the protocol through NTLMv1 and NTLMv2.

## Domain Cached Credentials (MSCache2)
In an AD environment, the authentication methods mentioned in this section and the previous require the host we are trying to access to communicate with the "brains" of the network, the Domain Controller. Microsoft developed the [MS Cache v1 and v2](https://webstersprodigy.net/2014/02/03/mscash-hash-primer-for-pentesters/) algorithm (also known as `Domain Cached Credentials` (DCC) to solve the potential issue of a domain-joined host being unable to communicate with a domain controller (i.e., due to a network outage or other technical issue) and, hence, NTLM/Kerberos authentication not working to access the host in question. Hosts save the last `ten` hashes for any domain users that successfully log into the machine in the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Cache` registry key.
These hashes cannot be used in pass-the-hash attacks. Furthermore, the hash is very slow to crack with a tool such as Hashcat, even when using an extremely powerful GPU cracking rig, so attempts to crack these hashes typically need to be extremely targeted or rely on a very weak password in use.
