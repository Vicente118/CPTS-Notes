[Intelligent Platform Management Interface](https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/IPMI_Basics) (`IPMI`) is a set of standardized specifications for hardware-based host management systems used for system management and monitoring. It acts as an autonomous subsystem and works independently of the host's BIOS, CPU, firmware, and underlying operating system. IPMI provides sysadmins with the ability to manage and monitor systems even if they are powered off or in an unresponsive state.

IPMI is typically used in three ways:
- Before the OS has booted to modify BIOS settings
- When the host is fully powered down
- Access to a host after a system failure

## Footprinting the Service
IPMI communicates over port 623 UDP.
Systems that use the IPMI protocol are called Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs).
BMCs are typically implemented as embedded ARM systems running Linux, and connected directly to the host's motherboard.

#### Nmap
```shell
$ sudo nmap -sU --script ipmi-version -p 623 ilo.inlanfreight.local

#### Metasploit Version Scan
```shell
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version 
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version) > set rhosts 10.129.42.195
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version) > show options 

Module options (auxiliary/scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version):

   THREADS    10               yes       The number of concurrent threads

During internal penetration tests, we often find BMCs where the administrators have not changed the default password. Some unique default passwords to keep in our cheatsheets include:

| Product         | Username      | Password                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dell iDRAC      | root          | calvin                                                                    |
| HP iLO          | Administrator | randomized 8-character string consisting of numbers and uppercase letters |
| Supermicro IPMI | ADMIN         | ADMIN                                                                     |


## Dangerous Settings

If default credentials do not work to access a BMC, we can turn to a [flaw](http://fish2.com/ipmi/remote-pw-cracking.html) in the RAKP protocol in IPMI 2.0. During the authentication process, the server sends a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the user's password to the client before authentication takes place. This can be leveraged to obtain the password hash for ANY valid user account on the BMC. These password hashes can then be cracked offline using a dictionary attack using `Hashcat` mode `7300`.
`hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 -1 ?d?u` which tries all combinations of upper case letters and numbers for an eight-character password.
