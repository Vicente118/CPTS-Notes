The `Simple Mail Transfer Protocol` (`SMTP`) is a protocol for sending emails in an IP network. It can be used between an email client and an outgoing mail server or between two SMTP servers.
SMTP is often combined with the IMAP or POP3 protocols, which can fetch emails and send emails.
By default, SMTP servers accept connection requests on port `25`. However, newer SMTP servers also use other ports such as TCP port `587`.
SMTP works unencrypted without further measures and transmits all commands, data, or authentication information in plain text. To prevent unauthorized reading of data, the SMTP is used in conjunction with SSL/TLS encryption. Under certain circumstances, a server uses a port other than the standard TCP port `25` for the encrypted connection, for example, TCP port `465`.

| Client (`MUA`) | `➞` | Submission Agent (`MSA`) | `➞` | Open Relay (`MTA`) | `➞` | Mail Delivery Agent (`MDA`) | `➞` | Mailbox (`POP3`/`IMAP`) |
| -------------- | --- | ------------------------ | --- | ------------------ | --- | --------------------------- | --- | ----------------------- |

## Default Configuration

Each SMTP server can be configured in many ways, as can all other services. However, there are differences because the SMTP server is only responsible for sending and forwarding emails.

#### Default Configuration

Each SMTP server can be configured in many ways, as can all other services. However, there are differences because the SMTP server is only responsible for sending and forwarding emails.

```shell
cat /etc/postfix/main.cf | grep -v "#" | sed -r "/^\s*$/d"

smtpd_banner = ESMTP Server 
biff = no
append_dot_mydomain = no
readme_directory = no
compatibility_level = 2
smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache
myhostname = mail1.inlanefreight.htb
alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
smtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost 
masquerade_domains = $myhostname
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 10.129.0.0/16
mailbox_size_limit = 0
recipient_delimiter = +
smtp_bind_address = 0.0.0.0
inet_protocols = ipv4
smtpd_helo_restrictions = reject_invalid_hostname
home_mailbox = /home/postfix
```

The sending and communication are also done by special commands that cause the SMTP server to do what the user requires.

| **Command**  | **Description**                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `AUTH PLAIN` | AUTH is a service extension used to authenticate the client.                                     |
| `HELO`       | The client logs in with its computer name and thus starts the session.                           |
| `MAIL FROM`  | The client names the email sender.                                                               |
| `RCPT TO`    | The client names the email recipient.                                                            |
| `DATA`       | The client initiates the transmission of the email.                                              |
| `RSET`       | The client aborts the initiated transmission but keeps the connection between client and server. |
| `VRFY`       | The client checks if a mailbox is available for message transfer.                                |
| `EXPN`       | The client also checks if a mailbox is available for messaging with this command.                |
| `NOOP`       | The client requests a response from the server to prevent disconnection due to time-out.         |
| `QUIT`       | The client terminates the session.                                                               |
To interact with the SMTP server, we can use the `telnet` tool to initialize a TCP connection with the SMTP server. The actual initialization of the session is done with the command mentioned above, `HELO` or `EHLO`.

#### Telnet - HELO/EHLO

```shell
$ telnet 10.129.14.128 25

Trying 10.129.14.128...
Connected to 10.129.14.128.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 ESMTP Server 


HELO mail1.inlanefreight.htb

250 mail1.inlanefreight.htb


EHLO mail1

250-mail1.inlanefreight.htb
250-PIPELINING
250-SIZE 10240000
250-ETRN
250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
250-8BITMIME
250-DSN
250-SMTPUTF8
250 CHUNKING
```

The command `VRFY` can be used to enumerate existing users on the system. However, this does not always work.


#### Telnet - VRFY

```shell
$ telnet 10.129.14.128 25

Trying 10.129.14.128...
Connected to 10.129.14.128.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 ESMTP Server 

VRFY root

252 2.0.0 root


VRFY cry0l1t3

252 2.0.0 cry0l1t3


VRFY testuser

252 2.0.0 testuser


VRFY aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

252 2.0.0 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```


Sometimes we may have to work through a web proxy. We can also make this web proxy connect to the SMTP server. The command that we would send would then look something like this: `CONNECT 10.129.14.128:25 HTTP/1.0`


#### Send an Email

```shell
$ telnet 10.129.14.128 25

Did you make any changes there?

### Dangerous Settings

#### Open Relay Configuration

```shell-session
mynetworks = 0.0.0.0/0
```

With this setting, this SMTP server can send fake emails and thus initialize communication between multiple parties. Another attack possibility would be to spoof the email and read it.



### Footprinting the Service
The default Nmap scripts include `smtp-commands`, which uses the `EHLO` command to list all possible commands that can be executed on the target SMTP server.

```shell
$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sC -sV -p25

## Questions

1.  Enumerate the SMTP service and submit the banner, including its version as the answer.
	- InFreight ESMTP v2.11

2. Enumerate the SMTP service even further and find the username that exists on the system. Submit it as the answer.
	 ```bash
	 > smtp-user-enum  10.129.105.94 25 -U footprinting-wordlist.txt -m RCPT
	
VRFY did not work but RCPT worked:

[SUCC] robin       250 2.1.5 Ok
	 ```
