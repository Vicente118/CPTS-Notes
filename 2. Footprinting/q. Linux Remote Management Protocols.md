## SSH

[Secure Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) (`SSH`) enables two computers to establish an encrypted and direct connection within a possibly insecure network on the standard port `TCP 22`.
The SSH server can also be configured to only allow connections from specific clients.

OpenSSH has six different authentication methods:
1. Password authentication
2. Public-key authentication
3. Host-based authentication
4. Keyboard authentication
5. Challenge-response authentication
6. GSSAPI authentication

#### Public Key Authentication

The private key is created individually for the user's own computer and secured with a passphrase that should be longer than a typical password. The private key is stored exclusively on our own computer and always remains secret. If we want to establish an SSH connection, we first enter the passphrase and thus open access to the private key.


## Default Configuration
The [sshd_config](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/sshd_config) file, responsible for the OpenSSH server, has only a few of the settings configured by default. However, the default configuration includes X11 forwarding, which contained a command injection vulnerability in version 7.2p1 of OpenSSH in 2016. Nevertheless, we do not need a GUI to manage our servers.
#### Default Configuration
```shell
$ cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config  | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'

Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
UsePAM yes
X11Forwarding yes
PrintMotd no
AcceptEnv LANG LC_*
Subsystem       sftp    /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
```


## Dangerous Settings
| **Setting**                  | **Description**                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `PasswordAuthentication yes` | Allows password-based authentication.       |
| `PermitEmptyPasswords yes`   | Allows the use of empty passwords.          |
| `PermitRootLogin yes`        | Allows to log in as the root user.          |
| `Protocol 1`                 | Uses an outdated version of encryption.     |
| `X11Forwarding yes`          | Allows X11 forwarding for GUI applications. |
| `AllowTcpForwarding yes`     | Allows forwarding of TCP ports.             |
| `PermitTunnel`               | Allows tunneling.                           |
| `DebianBanner yes`           | Displays a specific banner when logging in. |

## Rsync
[Rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) is a fast and efficient tool for locally and remotely copying files. It can be used to copy files locally on a given machine and to/from remote hosts. It is highly versatile and well-known for its delta-transfer algorithm.
By default, it uses port `873` and can be configured to use SSH for secure file transfers by piggybacking on top of an established SSH server connection.
This [guide](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/873-pentesting-rsync) covers some of the ways Rsync can be abused, most notably by listing the contents of a shared folder on a target server and retrieving files. This can sometimes be done without authentication. Other times we will need credentials.

#### Scanning for Rsync
```shell
$ sudo nmap -sV -p 873 127.0.0.1

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-09-19 09:31 EDT
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.0058s latency).

PORT    STATE SERVICE VERSION
873/tcp open  rsync   (protocol version 31)
```

#### Probing for Accessible Shares
```shell-session
nc -nv 127.0.0.1 873

(UNKNOWN) [127.0.0.1] 873 (rsync) open
@RSYNCD: 31.0
@RSYNCD: 31.0
#list
dev            	Dev Tools
@RSYNCD: EXIT
```


#### Enumerating an Open Share
Here we can see a share called `dev`, and we can enumerate it further.

```shell
$ rsync -av --list-only rsync://127.0.0.1/dev

receiving incremental file list
drwxr-xr-x             48 2022/09/19 09:43:10 .
-rw-r--r--              0 2022/09/19 09:34:50 build.sh
-rw-r--r--              0 2022/09/19 09:36:02 secrets.yaml
drwx------             54 2022/09/19 09:43:10 .ssh
```

Let's get all files from dev share: `rsync -av rsync://127.0.0.1/dev`
If Rsync is configured to use SSH to transfer files, we could modify our commands to include the `-e ssh` flag, or `-e "ssh -p2222"` if a non-standard port is in use for SSH. This [guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-rsync-over-ssh) is helpful for understanding the syntax for using Rsync over SSH.


## R-Services
R-Services are a suite of services hosted to enable remote access or issue commands between Unix hosts over TCP/IP.
`R-services` span across the ports `512`, `513`, and `514` and are only accessible through a suite of programs known as `r-commands`.

The [R-commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_r-commands) suite consists of the following programs:
- rcp (`remote copy`)
- rexec (`remote execution`)
- rlogin (`remote login`)
- rsh (`remote shell`)
- rstat
- ruptime
- rwho (`remote who`)

| **Command** | **Service Daemon** | **Port** | **Transport Protocol** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------ | -------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rcp`       | `rshd`             | 514      | TCP                    | Copy a file or directory bidirectionally from the local system to the remote system (or vice versa) or from one remote system to another. It works like the `cp` command on Linux but provides `no warning to the user for overwriting existing files on a system`.        |
| `rsh`       | `rshd`             | 514      | TCP                    | Opens a shell on a remote machine without a login procedure. Relies upon the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files for validation.                                                                                                                 |
| `rexec`     | `rexecd`           | 512      | TCP                    | Enables a user to run shell commands on a remote machine. Requires authentication through the use of a `username` and `password` through an unencrypted network socket. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files. |
| `rlogin`    | `rlogind`          | 513      | TCP                    | Enables a user to log in to a remote host over the network. It works similarly to `telnet` but can only connect to Unix-like hosts. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files.                                     |
The /etc/hosts.equiv file contains a list of trusted hosts and is used to grant access to other systems on the network. When users on one of these hosts attempt to access the system, they are automatically granted access without further authentication.

#### /etc/hosts.equiv\
```shell
$ cat /etc/hosts.equiv

# <hostname> <local username>
pwnbox cry0l1t3
```


#### Scanning for R-Services
```shell
$ sudo nmap -sV -p 512,513,514 10.0.17.2

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-12-02 15:02 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.0.17.2
Host is up (0.11s latency).

PORT    STATE SERVICE    VERSION
512/tcp open  exec?
513/tcp open  login?
514/tcp open  tcpwrapped
```


#### Access Control & Trusted Relationships
 R-services rely on trusted information sent from the remote client to the host machine they are attempting to authenticate to. By default, these services utilize [Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)](https://debathena.mit.edu/trac/wiki/PAM) for user authentication onto a remote system; however, they also bypass this authentication through the use of the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files on the system. The `hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files contain a list of hosts (`IPs` or `Hostnames`) and users that are `trusted` by the local host when a connection attempt is made using `r-commands`. Entries in either file can appear like the following:

**Note:** The `hosts.equiv` file is recognized as the global configuration regarding all users on a system, whereas `.rhosts` provides a per-user configuration.

#### Sample .rhosts File
```shell
$ cat .rhosts

htb-student     10.0.17.5
+               10.0.17.10
+               +
```

As we can see from this example, both files follow the specific syntax of `<username> <ip address>` or `<username> <hostname>` pairs. Additionally, the `+` modifier can be used within these files as a wildcard to specify anything.

#### Logging in Using Rlogin
```shell
$ rlogin 10.0.17.2 -l htb-student
Last login: Fri Dec  2 16:11:21 from localhost

[htb-student@localhost ~]$
```
We have successfully logged in under the `htb-student` account on the remote host due to the misconfigurations in the `.rhosts` file.

#### Listing Authenticated Users Using Rwho
```shell
$ rwho

root     web01:pts/0 Dec  2 21:34
htb-student     workstn01:tty1  Dec  2 19:57  2:25  
```


#### Listing Authenticated Users Using Rusers
This will give us a more detailed account of all logged-in users over the network, including information such as the username, hostname of the accessed machine, TTY that the user is logged in to, the date and time the user logged in, the amount of time since the user typed on the keyboard, and the remote host they logged in from (if applicable).

```shell
$ rusers -al 10.0.17.5

htb-student     10.0.17.5:console          Dec 2 19:57     2:25
```
