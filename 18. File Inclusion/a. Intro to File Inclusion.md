## Local File Inclusion (LFI)
LFI vulnerabilities can lead to source code disclosure, sensitive data exposure, and even remote code execution under certain conditions. Leaking source code may allow attackers to test the code for other vulnerabilities, which may reveal previously unknown vulnerabilities.

## Examples of Vulnerable Code
#### PHP
In `PHP`, we may use the `include()` function to load a local or a remote file as we load a page. If the `path` passed to the `include()` is taken from a user-controlled parameter, like a `GET` parameter, and `the code does not explicitly filter and sanitize the user input`, then the code becomes vulnerable to File Inclusion. The following code snippet shows an example of that:
```php
if (isset($_GET['language'])) {
    include($_GET['language']);
}
```

We see that the `language` parameter is directly passed to the `include()` function. So, any path we pass in the `language` parameter will be loaded on the page, including any local files on the back-end server. This is not exclusive to the `include()` function, as there are many other PHP functions that would lead to the same vulnerability if we had control over the path passed into them. Such functions include `include_once()`, `require()`, `require_once()`, `file_get_contents()`, and several others as well.

#### NodeJS
Just as the case with PHP, NodeJS web servers may also load content based on an HTTP parameters. The following is a basic example of how a GET parameter `language` is used to control what data is written to a page:
```javascript
if(req.query.language) {
    fs.readFile(path.join(__dirname, req.query.language), function (err, data) {
        res.write(data);
    });
}
```

As we can see, whatever parameter passed from the URL gets used by the `readfile` function, which then writes the file content in the HTTP response. Another example is the `render()` function in the `Express.js` framework. The following example shows how the `language` parameter is used to determine which directory to pull the `about.html` page from:
```js
app.get("/about/:language", function(req, res) {
    res.render(`/${req.params.language}/about.html`);
});
```

#### Java
The same concept applies to many other web servers. The following examples show how web applications for a Java web server may include local files based on the specified parameter, using the `include` function:
```jsp
<c:if test="${not empty param.language}">
    <jsp:include file="<%= request.getParameter('language') %>" />
</c:if>
```

The `include` function may take a file or a page URL as its argument and then renders the object into the front-end template, similar to the ones we saw earlier with NodeJS. The `import` function may also be used to render a local file or a URL, such as the following example:
```jsp
<c:import url= "<%= request.getParameter('language') %>"/>
```

#### .NET
Finally, let's take an example of how File Inclusion vulnerabilities may occur in .NET web applications. The `Response.WriteFile` function works very similarly to all of our earlier examples, as it takes a file path for its input and writes its content to the response.
```cs
@if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(HttpContext.Request.Query['language'])) {
    <% Response.WriteFile("<% HttpContext.Request.Query['language'] %>"); %> 
}
```

Furthermore, the `@Html.Partial()` function may also be used to render the specified file as part of the front-end template, similarly to what we saw earlier:
```cs
@Html.Partial(HttpContext.Request.Query['language'])
```

Finally, the `include` function may be used to render local files or remote URLs, and may also execute the specified files as well:
```cs
<!--#include file="<% HttpContext.Request.Query['language'] %>"-->
```

## Read vs Execute
The most important thing to keep in mind is that `some of the above functions only read the content of the specified files, while others also execute the specified files`.

The following table shows which functions may execute files and which only read file content:
