## Windows Defender
#### Checking the Status of Defender with Get-MpComputerStatus
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-MpComputerStatus
...
AntispywareEnabled              : True
...
AntivirusEnabled                : True

```
## AppLocker
An application whitelist is a list of approved software applications or executables that are allowed to be present and run on a system. The goal is to protect the environment from harmful malware and unapproved software that does not align with the specific business needs of an organization.
Organizations also often focus on blocking the `PowerShell.exe` executable, but forget about the other [PowerShell executable locations](https://www.powershelladmin.com/wiki/PowerShell_Executables_File_System_Locations) such as `%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` or `PowerShell_ISE.exe`.
#### Using Get-AppLockerPolicy cmdlet
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-AppLockerPolicy -Effective | select -ExpandProperty RuleCollections

## PowerShell Constrained Language Mode
PowerShell [Constrained Language Mode](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-constrained-language-mode/) locks down many of the features needed to use PowerShell effectively, such as blocking COM objects, only allowing approved .NET types, XAML-based workflows, PowerShell classes, and more. We can quickly enumerate whether we are in Full Language Mode or Constrained Language Mode.
```powershell
PS C:\htb> $ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode

ConstrainedLanguage
```
## LAPS
The Microsoft [Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899) is used to randomize and rotate local administrator passwords on Windows hosts and prevent lateral movement.
We can enumerate what domain users can read the LAPS password set for machines with LAPS installed and what machines do not have LAPS installed.
The [LAPSToolkit](https://github.com/leoloobeek/LAPSToolkit) greatly facilitates this with several functions

#### Using Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups

OrgUnit                                             Delegated Groups

```

The `Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights` checks the rights on each computer with LAPS enabled for any groups with read access and users with "All Extended Rights." Users with "All Extended Rights" can read LAPS passwords and may be less protected than users in delegated groups, so this is worth checking for.
#### Using Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights

ComputerName                Identity                    Reason
------------                --------                    ------
EXCHG01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins Delegated
EXCHG01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins   Delegated
SQL01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL   INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins Delegated
SQL01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL   INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins   Delegated
WS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL    INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins Delegated
WS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL    INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins   Delegated
```
We can use the `Get-LAPSComputers` function to search for computers that have LAPS enabled when passwords expire, and even the randomized passwords in cleartext if our user has access.
#### Using Get-LAPSComputers
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-LAPSComputers

ComputerName                Password       Expiration
