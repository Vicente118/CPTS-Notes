## ActiveDirectory PowerShell Module
The ActiveDirectory PowerShell module is a group of PowerShell cmdlets for administering an Active Directory environment from the command line.
#### Load ActiveDirectory Module
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Import-Module ActiveDirectory
PS C:\htb> Get-Module

ModuleType Version    Name                                ExportedCommands

```

Basic information about the domain with the [Get-ADDomain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-addomain?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet.
### Get Domain Info
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-ADDomain
```
Next, we'll use the [Get-ADUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-aduser?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet. We will be filtering for accounts with the `ServicePrincipalName` property populated. This will get us a listing of accounts that may be susceptible to a Kerberoasting attack, which we will cover in-depth after the next section.
#### Get-ADUser
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-ADUser -Filter {ServicePrincipalName -ne "$null"} -Properties ServicePrincipalName
```

Another interesting check we can run utilizing the ActiveDirectory module, would be to verify domain trust relationships using the [Get-ADTrust](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-adtrust?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet
#### Checking For Trust Relationships
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-ADTrust -Filter *
```

We can gather AD group information using the [Get-ADGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-adgroup?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet.
#### Group Enumeration
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroup -Filter * | select name
```
We can take the results and feed interesting names back into the cmdlet to get more detailed information about a particular group like so:
#### Detailed Group Info
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroup -Identity "Backup Operators"
```

Now that we know more about the group, let's get a member listing using the [Get-ADGroupMember](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-adgroupmember?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet.
### Group Membership
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Backup Operators"
```

## PowerView
[PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Recon) is a tool written in PowerShell to help us gain situational awareness within an AD environment. Much like BloodHound, it provides a way to identify where users are logged in on a network, enumerate domain information such as users, computers, groups, ACLS, trusts, hunt for file shares and passwords, perform Kerberoasting, and more.

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Export-PowerViewCSV`|Append results to a CSV file|
|`ConvertTo-SID`|Convert a User or group name to its SID value|
|`Get-DomainSPNTicket`|Requests the Kerberos ticket for a specified Service Principal Name (SPN) account|
|**Domain/LDAP Functions:**||
|`Get-Domain`|Will return the AD object for the current (or specified) domain|
|`Get-DomainController`|Return a list of the Domain Controllers for the specified domain|
|`Get-DomainUser`|Will return all users or specific user objects in AD|
|`Get-DomainComputer`|Will return all computers or specific computer objects in AD|
|`Get-DomainGroup`|Will return all groups or specific group objects in AD|
|`Get-DomainOU`|Search for all or specific OU objects in AD|
|`Find-InterestingDomainAcl`|Finds object ACLs in the domain with modification rights set to non-built in objects|
|`Get-DomainGroupMember`|Will return the members of a specific domain group|
|`Get-DomainFileServer`|Returns a list of servers likely functioning as file servers|
|`Get-DomainDFSShare`|Returns a list of all distributed file systems for the current (or specified) domain|
|**GPO Functions:**||
|`Get-DomainGPO`|Will return all GPOs or specific GPO objects in AD|
|`Get-DomainPolicy`|Returns the default domain policy or the domain controller policy for the current domain|
|**Computer Enumeration Functions:**||
|`Get-NetLocalGroup`|Enumerates local groups on the local or a remote machine|
|`Get-NetLocalGroupMember`|Enumerates members of a specific local group|
|`Get-NetShare`|Returns open shares on the local (or a remote) machine|
|`Get-NetSession`|Will return session information for the local (or a remote) machine|
|`Test-AdminAccess`|Tests if the current user has administrative access to the local (or a remote) machine|
|**Threaded 'Meta'-Functions:**||
|`Find-DomainUserLocation`|Finds machines where specific users are logged in|
|`Find-DomainShare`|Finds reachable shares on domain machines|
|`Find-InterestingDomainShareFile`|Searches for files matching specific criteria on readable shares in the domain|
|`Find-LocalAdminAccess`|Find machines on the local domain where the current user has local administrator access|
|**Domain Trust Functions:**||
|`Get-DomainTrust`|Returns domain trusts for the current domain or a specified domain|
|`Get-ForestTrust`|Returns all forest trusts for the current forest or a specified forest|
|`Get-DomainForeignUser`|Enumerates users who are in groups outside of the user's domain|
|`Get-DomainForeignGroupMember`|Enumerates groups with users outside of the group's domain and returns each foreign member|
|`Get-DomainTrustMapping`|Will enumerate all trusts for the current domain and any others seen.|

The [Get-DomainUser](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainUser/) function will provide us with information on all users or specific users we specify. Below we will use it to grab information about a specific user, `mmorgan`.
#### Domain User Information
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Identity mmorgan -Domain inlanefreight.local | Select-Object -Property name,samaccountname,description,memberof,whencreated,pwdlastset,lastlogontimestamp,accountexpires,admincount,userprincipalname,serviceprincipalname,useraccountcontrol
```

 Now let's enumerate some domain group information. We can use the [Get-DomainGroupMember](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainGroupMember/) function to retrieve group-specific information. Adding the `-Recurse` switch tells PowerView that if it finds any groups that are part of the target group (nested group membership) to list out the members of those groups.
#### Recursive Group Membership
```powershell
PS C:\htb>  Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Recurse
```

Like with the AD PowerShell module, we can also enumerate domain trust mappings.
#### Trust Enumeration
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainTrustMapping
```

We can use the [Test-AdminAccess](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Test-AdminAccess/) function to test for local admin access on either the current machine or a remote one.
#### Testing for Local Admin Access
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Test-AdminAccess -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-MS01

ComputerName    IsAdmin
------------    -------
ACADEMY-EA-MS01    True 
```
Above, we determined that the user we are currently using is an administrator on the host ACADEMY-EA-MS01.

 We can check for users with the SPN attribute set, which indicates that the account may be subjected to a Kerberoasting attack.
#### Finding Users With SPN Set
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -SPN -Properties samaccountname,ServicePrincipalName
```

## SharpView
Another tool worth experimenting with is SharpView, a .NET port of PowerView. Many of the same functions supported by PowerView can be used with SharpView. We can type a method name with `-Help` to get an argument list.
```powershell
PS C:\htb> .\SharpView.exe Get-DomainUser -Help
```

Here we can use SharpView to enumerate information about a specific user, such as the user `forend`, which we control.
```powershell
PS C:\htb> .\SharpView.exe Get-DomainUser -Identity forend
```

---
## Shares
In an attack, gaining control over a standard domain user who can access shares such as the IT/infrastructure shares could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data such as configuration files or authentication files like SSH keys or passwords stored insecurely.
We can use PowerView to hunt for shares and then help us dig through them or use various manual commands to hunt for common strings such as files with `pass` in the name.

## Snaffler
[Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler) is a tool that can help us acquire credentials or other sensitive data in an Active Directory environment. Snaffler works by obtaining a list of hosts within the domain and then enumerating those hosts for shares and readable directories.
#### Snaffler Execution
```bash
Snaffler.exe -s -d inlanefreight.local -o snaffler.log -v data
```
`-s` : Print the reslult in the console
`-d` : Specifies the domain
`-o` : Output file 
`-v` : Verbosity level (data is fine in general)


### SharpHound 
We'll start by running the SharpHound.exe collector from the MS01 attack host.
```powershell
PS C:\htb> .\SharpHound.exe -c All --zipfilename ILFREIGHT
```
Next, we can exfiltrate the dataset to our own VM.

### Pre-built Queries
#### Outdated OS
The query `Find Computers with Unsupported Operating Systems` is great for finding outdated and unsupported operating systems running legacy software.

#### Local Admins
We will often see users with local admin rights on their host (perhaps temporarily to install a piece of software, and the rights were never removed), or they occupy a high enough role in the organization to demand these rights (whether they require them or not).

We can run the query `Find Computers where Domain Users are Local Admin` to quickly see if there are any hosts where all users have local admin rights.
