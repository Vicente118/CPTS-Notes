## Domain Trusts Overview
A [trust](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/50969.active-directory-forest-trust-attention-points.aspx) is used to establish forest-forest or domain-domain (intra-domain) authentication, which allows users to access resources in (or perform administrative tasks) another domain, outside of the main domain where their account resides.

An organization can create various types of trusts:
- `Parent-child`: Two or more domains within the same forest. The child domain has a two-way transitive trust with the parent domain, meaning that users in the child domain `corp.inlanefreight.local` could authenticate into the parent domain `inlanefreight.local`, and vice-versa.
- `Cross-link`: A trust between child domains to speed up authentication.
- `External`: A non-transitive trust between two separate domains in separate forests which are not already joined by a forest trust. This type of trust utilizes [SID filtering](https://www.serverbrain.org/active-directory-2008/sid-history-and-sid-filtering.html) or filters out authentication requests (by SID) not from the trusted domain.
- `Tree-root`: A two-way transitive trust between a forest root domain and a new tree root domain. They are created by design when you set up a new tree root domain within a forest.
- `Forest`: A transitive trust between two forest root domains.
- [ESAE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/compass/esae-retirement): A bastion forest used to manage Active Directory.


Trusts can be transitive or non-transitive.
- A `transitive` trust means that trust is extended to objects that the child domain trusts. For example, let's say we have three domains. In a transitive relationship, if `Domain A` has a trust with `Domain B`, and `Domain B` has a `transitive` trust with `Domain C`, then `Domain A` will automatically trust `Domain C`.
- In a `non-transitive trust`, the child domain itself is the only one trusted.


#### Trust Table Side By Side
| Transitive                                                            | Non-Transitive                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Shared, 1 to many                                                     | Direct trust                                |
| The trust is shared with anyone in the forest                         | Not extended to next level child domains    |
| Forest, tree-root, parent-child, and cross-link trusts are transitive | Typical for external or custom trust setups |

Trusts can be set up in two directions: one-way or two-way (bidirectional).
- `One-way trust`: Users in a `trusted` domain can access resources in a trusting domain, not vice-versa.
- `Bidirectional trust`: Users from both trusting domains can access resources in the other domain. For example, in a bidirectional trust between `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` and `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL`, users in `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` would be able to access resources in `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL`, and vice-versa.


Below is a graphical representation of the various trust types.

## Enumerating Trust Relationships
We can use the [Get-ADTrust](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/get-adtrust?view=windowsserver2022-ps) cmdlet to enumerate domain trust relationships. This is especially helpful if we are limited to just using built-in tools.
#### Using Get-ADTrust
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Import-Module activedirectory
PS C:\htb> Get-ADTrust -Filter *

Direction               : BiDirectional
DisallowTransivity      : False

ForestTransitive        : False
IntraForest             : True
IsTreeParent            : False
IsTreeRoot              : False

TrustedPolicy           :
TrustingPolicy          :
TrustType               : Uplevel
UplevelOnly             : False
UsesAESKeys             : False
UsesRC4Encryption       : False

Direction               : BiDirectional
DisallowTransivity      : False
DistinguishedName       : CN=FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL,CN=System,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
ForestTransitive        : True
IntraForest             : False
IsTreeParent            : False
IsTreeRoot              : False
Name                    : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
ObjectClass             : trustedDomain

Target                  : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
TGTDelegation           : False
TrustAttributes         : 8
TrustedPolicy           :
TrustingPolicy          :
TrustType               : Uplevel
UplevelOnly             : False
UsesAESKeys             : False
UsesRC4Encryption       : False
```

The above output shows that our current domain `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` has two domain trusts. The first is with `LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`, and the `IntraForest` property shows that this is a child domain, and we are currently positioned in the root domain of the forest. The second trust is with the domain `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL,` and the `ForestTransitive` property is set to `True`, which means that this is a forest trust or external trust.

Aside from using built-in AD tools such as the Active Directory PowerShell module, both PowerView and BloodHound can be utilized to enumerate trust relationships, the type of trusts established, and the authentication flow.

#### Checking for Existing Trusts using Get-DomainTrust
```powershell
(Import Powerview)
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainTrust 

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : WITHIN_FOREST
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 6:20:22 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/26/2022 11:55:55 PM

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : FOREST_TRANSITIVE
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 8:07:09 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/27/2022 12:02:39 AM
```

#### Using Get-DomainTrustMapping
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainTrustMapping

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY

WhenChanged     : 2/26/2022 11:55:55 PM

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL

```

#### Checking Users in the Child Domain using Get-DomainUser
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Domain LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL | select SamAccountName

samaccountname
--------------
htb-student_adm
Administrator
Guest
lab_adm
krbtgt
```

Another tool we can use to get Domain Trust is `netdom`. The `netdom query` sub-command of the `netdom` command-line tool in Windows can retrieve information about the domain, including a list of workstations, servers, and domain trusts.
#### Using netdom to query domain trust
```cmd-session
C:\htb> netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local trust
Direction Trusted\Trusting domain                         Trust type
========= =======================                         ==========

<->       LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Direct
 Not found

<->       FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL
Direct
 Not found

The command completed successfully.
```

#### Using netdom to query domain controllers
```cmd-session
C:\htb> netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local dc
List of domain controllers with accounts in the domain:

ACADEMY-EA-DC01
The command completed successfully.
```
#### Using netdom to query workstations and servers
```cmd-session
C:\htb> netdom query /domain:inlanefreight.local workstation
List of workstations with accounts in the domain:

ACADEMY-EA-MS01
ACADEMY-EA-MX01      ( Workstation or Server )

SQL01      ( Workstation or Server )
ILF-XRG      ( Workstation or Server )
MAINLON      ( Workstation or Server )
CISERVER      ( Workstation or Server )
INDEX-DEV-LON      ( Workstation or Server )
...SNIP...
```

---
We can also use BloodHound to visualize these trust relationships by using the `Map Domain Trusts` pre-built query. Here we can easily see that two bidirectional trusts exist.
