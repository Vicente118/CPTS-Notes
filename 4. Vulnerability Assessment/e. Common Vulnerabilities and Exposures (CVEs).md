## Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)
[Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)](https://oval.mitre.org/) is a publicly available information security international standard used to evaluate and detail the system's current state and issues.
The goal of the OVAL language is to have a three-step structure during the assessment process that consists of:
- Identifying a system's configurations for testing
- Evaluating the current system's state
- Disclosing the information in a report

The information can be described in various types of states, including: `Vulnerable`, `Non-compliant`, `Installed Asset`, and `Patched`.

#### OVAL Definitions
The OVAL definitions are recorded in an XML format to discover any software vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, programs, and additional system information taking out the need to exploit a system.
