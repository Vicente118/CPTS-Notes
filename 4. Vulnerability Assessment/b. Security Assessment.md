The primary purpose of most types of security assessments is to find and confirm vulnerabilities are present, so we can work to `patch`, `mitigate`, or `remove` them.

### Vulnerability Assessment
`Vulnerability assessments` are appropriate for all organizations and networks. A vulnerability assessment is based on a particular security standard, and compliance with these standards is analyzed (e.g., going through a checklist).

### Penetration Test
They're called penetration tests because testers conduct them to determine if and how they can penetrate a network. A pentest is a type of simulated cyber attack, and pentesters conduct actions that a threat actor may perform to see if certain kinds of exploits are possible.

`Black box` pentesting is done with no knowledge of a network's configuration or applications.
`Grey box` pentesting is done with a little bit of knowledge of the network they're testing, from a perspective equivalent to an `employee` who doesn't work in the IT department, such as a `receptionist` or `customer service agent`.
`White box` pentesting is typically conducted by giving the penetration tester full access to all systems, configurations, build documents, etc., and source code if web applications are in-scope.

`Application` pentesters assess web applications, thick-client applications, APIs, and mobile applications. They will often be well-versed in source code review and able to assess a given web application from a black box or white box standpoint (typically a secure code review).

`Network` or `infrastructure` pentesters assess all aspects of a computer network, including its `networking devices` such as routers and firewalls, workstations, servers, and applications.

`Physical` pentesters try to leverage physical security weaknesses and breakdowns in processes to gain access to a facility such as a data center or office building.

`Social engineering` pentesters test human beings.

### Vulnerability Assessments vs. Penetration Tests

Vulnerability assessments look for vulnerabilities in networks without simulating cyber attacks. During a vulnerability assessment, the assessor will typically run a vulnerability scan and then perform validation on critical, high, and medium-risk vulnerabilities. This means that they will show evidence that the vulnerability exists and is not a false positive, often using other tools, but will not seek to perform privilege escalation, lateral movement, post-exploitation, etc., if they validate, for example, a remote code execution vulnerability.

A `pentest` is a simulated cyber attack to see if and how the network can be penetrated. Regardless of a company's size, industry, or network design, pentests should only be performed after some vulnerability assessments have been conducted successfully and with fixes.

### Other Types of Security Assessments

#### Security Audits
`Security audits` are typically requirements from outside the organization, and they're typically mandated by `government agencies` or `industry associations` to assure that an organization is compliant with specific security regulations.
For example, all online and offline retailers, restaurants, and service providers who accept major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, AMEX, etc.) must comply with the [PCI-DSS "Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard"](https://www.pcicomplianceguide.org/faq/#1). PCI DSS is a regulation enforced by the [Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/), an organization run by credit card companies and financial service industry entities.

#### Bug Bounties
`Bug bounty programs` are implemented by all kinds of organizations. They invite members of the general public, with some restrictions (usually no automated scanning), to find security vulnerabilities in their applications.

#### Red Team Assessment
A red team is a type of evasive black box pentesting, simulating all kinds of cyber attacks from the perspective of an external threat actor. These assessments typically have an end goal (i.e., reaching a critical server or database, etc.). The assessors only report the vulnerabilities that led to the completion of the goal, not as many vulnerabilities as possible as with a penetration test.

#### Purple Team Assessment
`Purple teams` are formed when `offensive` and `defensive` security specialists work together with a common goal, to improve the security of their network. Red teams find security problems, and blue teams learn about those problems from their red teams and work to fix them. A purple team assessment is like a red team assessment, but the blue team is also involved at every step.
