Nessus gives us the option to export scan results in a variety of report formats as well as the option to export raw Nessus scan results to be imported into other tools.

## Nessus Reports
Once a scan is completed we can choose to export a report in `.pdf`, `.html`, or `.csv` formats.

## Exporting Nessus Scans
Nessus also gives the option to export scans into two formats `Nessus (scan.nessus)` or `Nessus DB (scan.db)`. The `.nessus` file is an `.xml` file and includes a copy of the scan settings and plugin outputs. The `.db` file contains the `.nessus` file and the scan's KB, plugin Audit Trail, and any scan attachments. More information about the `KB` and `Audit Trail` can be found [here](https://community.tenable.com/s/article/What-is-included-in-a-nessus-db-file).
Scripts such as the [nessus-report-downloader](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eelsivart/nessus-report-downloader/master/nessus6-report-downloader.rb) can be used to quickly download scan results in all available formats from the CLI using the Nessus REST API:

```shell-session
$ ./nessus_downloader.rb 
```
