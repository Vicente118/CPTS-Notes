A `Vulnerability Assessment` aims to identify and categorize risks for security weaknesses related to assets within an environment. It is important to note that `there is little to no manual exploitation during a vulnerability assessment`. A vulnerability assessment also provides remediation steps to fix the issues.
The purpose of a `Vulnerability Assessment` is to understand, identify, and categorize the risk for the more apparent issues present in an environment without actually exploiting them to gain further access.


### Methodology
Below is a sample vulnerability assessment methodology that most organizations could follow and find success with. Methodologies may vary slightly from organization to organization, but this chart covers the main steps, from identifying assets to creating a remediation plan.

## Understanding Key Terms

#### Vulnerability
A `Vulnerability` is a weakness or bug in an organization's environment, including applications, networks, and infrastructure, that opens up the possibility of threats from external actors.

#### Threat
A `Threat` is a process that amplifies the potential of an adverse event, such as a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability. Some vulnerabilities raise more threat concerns over others due to the probability of the vulnerability being exploited.

#### Exploit
An `Exploit` is any code or resources that can be used to take advantage of an asset's weakness.

#### Risk
`Risk` is the possibility of assets or data being harmed or destroyed by threat actors.


To differentiate the three, we can think of it as follows:
- `Risk`: something bad that could happen
- `Threat`: something bad that is happening
- `Vulnerabilities`: weaknesses that could lead to a threat


We can use a qualitative risk matrix to measure risk based on likelihood and impact with the table shown below.

## Asset Management
When an organization of any kind, in any industry, and of any size needs to plan their cybersecurity strategy, they should start by creating an inventory of their `data assets`. If you want to protect something, you must first know what you are protecting! Once assets have been inventoried, then you can start the process of `asset management`. This is a key concept in defensive security.
#### Asset Inventory
`Asset inventory` is a critical component of vulnerability management. An organization needs to understand what assets are in its network to provide the proper protection and set up appropriate defenses. The asset inventory should include information technology, operational technology, physical, software, mobile, and development assets.

#### Application and System Inventory
An organization should create a thorough and complete inventory of data assets for proper asset management for defensive security. Data assets include:
- All data stored on-premises. HDDs and SSDs in endpoints (PCs and mobile devices), HDDs & SSDs in servers, external drives in the local network, optical media (DVDs, Blu-ray discs, CDs), flash media (USB sticks, SD cards). Legacy technology may include floppy disks, ZIP drives (a relic from the 1990s), and tape drives.
- All of the data storage that their cloud provider possesses. [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (`AWS`), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (`GCP`), and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) are some of the most popular cloud providers, but there are many more.
- All data stored within various `Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)` applications.
- All of the applications a company needs to use to conduct their usual operation and business.
-  All of a company's on-premises computer networking devices. These include but aren't limited to `routers`, `firewalls`, `hubs`, `switches`, dedicated `intrusion detection` and `prevention systems` (`IDS/IPS`), `data loss prevention` (`DLP`) systems, and so on.
