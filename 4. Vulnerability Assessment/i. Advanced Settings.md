## Scan Policies
Nessus gives us the option to create scan policies. Essentially these are customized scans that allow us to define specific scan options, save the policy configuration, and have them available to us under `Scan Templates` when creating a new scan.

## Creating a Scan Policy
To create a scan policy, we can click on the `New Policy` button in the top right, and we will be presented with the list of pre-configured scans. We can choose a scan, such as the `Basic Network Scan`, then customize it, or we can create our own. We will choose `Advanced Scan` to create a fully customized scan with no pre-configured recommendations built-in.

From here, we can configure settings, add in any necessary credentials, and specify any compliance standards to run the scan against. We can also choose to enable or disable entire [plugin](https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/Plugins.htm) families or individual plugins.

A searchable database of all published plugins is on the [Tenable website](https://www.tenable.com/plugins).

## Scanning with Credentials
Nessus also supports credentialed scanning and provides a lot of flexibility by supporting LM/NTLM hashes, Kerberos authentication, and password authentication.

Credentials can be configured for host-based authentication via SSH with a password, public key, certificate, or Kerberos-based authentication. It can also be configured for Windows host-based authentication with a password, Kerberos, LM hash, or NTLM hash:

Nessus also supports authentication for a variety of databases types including Oracle, PostgreSQL, DB2, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, and Sybase:

In addition to that, Nessus can perform plaintext authentication to services such as FTP, HTTP, IMAP, IPMI, Telnet, and more:

Finally, we can check the Nessus output to confirm whether the authentication to the target application or service with the supplied credentials was successful:
