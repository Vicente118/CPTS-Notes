## Reconnaissance Frameworks
These frameworks aim to provide a complete suite of tools for web reconnaissance:

- [FinalRecon](https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/FinalRecon): A Python-based reconnaissance tool offering a range of modules for different tasks like SSL certificate checking, Whois information gathering, header analysis, and crawling. Its modular structure enables easy customisation for specific needs.
- [Recon-ng](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng): A powerful framework written in Python that offers a modular structure with various modules for different reconnaissance tasks. It can perform DNS enumeration, subdomain discovery, port scanning, web crawling, and even exploit known vulnerabilities.
- [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester): Specifically designed for gathering email addresses, subdomains, hosts, employee names, open ports, and banners from different public sources like search engines, PGP key servers, and the SHODAN database. It is a command-line tool written in Python.
- [SpiderFoot](https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot): An open-source intelligence automation tool that integrates with various data sources to collect information about a target, including IP addresses, domain names, email addresses, and social media profiles. It can perform DNS lookups, web crawling, port scanning, and more.
- [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/): A collection of various tools and resources for open-source intelligence gathering. It covers a wide range of information sources, including social media, search engines, public records, and more.

### FinalRecon

`FinalRecon`Â offers a wealth of recon information:

- `Header Information`: Reveals server details, technologies used, and potential security misconfigurations.
- `Whois Lookup`: Uncovers domain registration details, including registrant information and contact details.
- `SSL Certificate Information`: Examines the SSL/TLS certificate for validity, issuer, and other relevant details.
- `Crawler`:
    - HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Extracts links, resources, and potential vulnerabilities from these files.
    - Internal/External Links: Maps out the website's structure and identifies connections to other domains.
    - Images, robots.txt, sitemap.xml: Gathers information about allowed/disallowed crawling paths and website structure.
    - Links in JavaScript, Wayback Machine: Uncovers hidden links and historical website data.
- `DNS Enumeration`: Queries over 40 DNS record types, including DMARC records for email security assessment.
- `Subdomain Enumeration`: Leverages multiple data sources (crt.sh, AnubisDB, ThreatMiner, CertSpotter, Facebook API, VirusTotal API, Shodan API, BeVigil API) to discover subdomains.
- `Directory Enumeration`: Supports custom wordlists and file extensions to uncover hidden directories and files.
- `Wayback Machine`: Retrieves URLs from the last five years to analyse website changes and potential vulnerabilities.
