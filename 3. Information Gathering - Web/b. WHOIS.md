WHOIS is a widely used query and response protocol designed to access databases that store information about registered internet resources.

```shell
$ whois inlanefreight.com

[...]
Domain Name: inlanefreight.com
Registry Domain ID: 2420436757_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN
Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.registrar.amazon
Registrar URL: https://registrar.amazon.com
Updated Date: 2023-07-03T01:11:15Z

```

Each WHOIS record typically contains the following information:
- `Domain Name`: The domain name itself (e.g., example.com)
- `Registrar`: The company where the domain was registered (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap)
- `Registrant Contact`: The person or organization that registered the domain.
- `Administrative Contact`: The person responsible for managing the domain.
- `Technical Contact`: The person handling technical issues related to the domain.
- `Creation and Expiration Dates`: When the domain was registered and when it's set to expire.
- `Name Servers`: Servers that translate the domain name into an IP address.


## Why WHOIS Matters for Web Recon

WHOIS data serves as a treasure trove of information for penetration testers during the reconnaissance phase of an assessment. It offers valuable insights into the target organisation's digital footprint and potential vulnerabilities:

- `Identifying Key Personnel`: WHOIS records often reveal the names, email addresses, and phone numbers of individuals responsible for managing the domain. This information can be leveraged for social engineering attacks or to identify potential targets for phishing campaigns.
- `Discovering Network Infrastructure`: Technical details like name servers and IP addresses provide clues about the target's network infrastructure. This can help penetration testers identify potential entry points or misconfigurations.
- `Historical Data Analysis`: Accessing historical WHOIS records through services like [WhoisFreaks](https://whoisfreaks.com/) can reveal changes in ownership, contact information, or technical details over time. This can be useful for tracking the evolution of the target's digital presence.
