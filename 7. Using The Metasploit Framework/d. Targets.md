`Targets`Â are unique operating system identifiers taken from the versions of those specific operating systems which adapt the selected exploit module to run on that particular version of the operating system. TheÂ `show targets`Â command issued within an exploit module view will display all available vulnerable targets for that specific exploit, while issuing the same command in the root menu, outside of any selected exploit module, will let us know that we need to select an exploit module first.

#### MSF - Show Targets

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/browser/ie_execcommand_uaf) > show targets

Exploit targets:

   Id  Name

   1   IE 7 on Windows XP SP3
   2   IE 8 on Windows XP SP3
   3   IE 7 on Windows Vista
   4   IE 8 on Windows Vista
   5   IE 8 on Windows 7
   6   IE 9 on Windows 7
```

```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/browser/ie_execcommand_uaf) > set target 6
