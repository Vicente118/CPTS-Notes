## What is XSS
A typical web application works by receiving the HTML code from the back-end server and rendering it on the client-side internet browser. When a vulnerable web application does not properly sanitize user input, a malicious user can inject extra JavaScript code in an input field (e.g., comment/reply), so once another user views the same page, they unknowingly execute the malicious JavaScript code.

XSS vulnerabilities are solely executed on the client-side and hence do not directly affect the back-end server. They can only affect the user executing the vulnerability. The direct impact of XSS vulnerabilities on the back-end server may be relatively low, but they are very commonly found in web applications, so this equates to a medium risk (`low impact + high probability = medium risk`), which we should always attempt to `reduce` risk by detecting, remediating, and proactively preventing these types of vulnerabilities.

## XSS Attacks
XSS vulnerabilities can facilitate a wide range of attacks, which can be anything that can be executed through browser JavaScript code. A basic example of an XSS attack is having the target user unwittingly send their session cookie to the attacker's web server. Another example is having the target's browser execute API calls that lead to a malicious action, like changing the user's password to a password of the attacker's choosing. There are many other types of XSS attacks, from Bitcoin mining to displaying ads.

## Types of XSS
| Type                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Stored (Persistent) XSS`        | The most critical type of XSS, which occurs when user input is stored on the back-end database and then displayed upon retrieval (e.g., posts or comments)                                                                                   |
| `Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS` | Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after being processed by the backend server, but without being stored (e.g., search result or error message)                                                                                 |
| `DOM-based XSS`                  | Another Non-Persistent XSS type that occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is completely processed on the client-side, without reaching the back-end server (e.g., through client-side HTTP parameters or anchor tags) |
