## Automated Discovery
Some of the common open-source tools that can assist us in XSS discovery are [XSS Strike](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike), [Brute XSS](https://github.com/rajeshmajumdar/BruteXSS), and [XSSer](https://github.com/epsylon/xsser).

We can then run the script and provide it a URL with a parameter using `-u`. Let's try using it with our `Reflected XSS` example from the earlier section:
```shell
> python xsstrike.py -u "http://SERVER_IP:PORT/index.php?task=test" 

        XSStrike v3.1.4

## Manual Discovery
When it comes to manual XSS discovery, the difficulty of finding the XSS vulnerability depends on the level of security of the web application. Basic XSS vulnerabilities can usually be found through testing various XSS payloads, but identifying advanced XSS vulnerabilities requires advanced code review skills.
#### XSS Payloads
The most basic method of looking for XSS vulnerabilities is manually testing various XSS payloads against an input field in a given web page. We can find huge lists of XSS payloads online, like the one on [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/XSS%20Injection/README.md) or the one in [PayloadBox](https://github.com/payloadbox/xss-payload-list). We can then begin testing these payloads one by one by copying each one and adding it in our form, and seeing whether an alert box pops up.

Note: XSS can be injected into any input in the HTML page, which is not exclusive to HTML input fields, but may also be in HTTP headers like the Cookie or User-Agent (i.e., when their values are displayed on the page).

## Code Review
The most reliable method of detecting XSS vulnerabilities is manual code review, which should cover both back-end and front-end code. If we understand precisely how our input is being handled all the way until it reaches the web browser, we can write a custom payload that should work with high confidence.
