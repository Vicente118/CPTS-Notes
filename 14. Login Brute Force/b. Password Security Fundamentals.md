## The Perils of Default Credentials
One critical aspect of password security often overlooked is the danger posed by `default passwords`. These pre-set passwords come with various devices, software, or online services. They are often simple and easily guessable, making them a prime target for attackers.

Alongside default passwords, default usernames are another major security concern. Manufacturers often ship devices with pre-set usernames, such as `admin`, `root`, or `user`. You might have noticed in the table above how many use common usernames. These usernames are widely known and often published in documentation or readily available online. SecLists maintains a list of common usernames at [top-usernames-shortlist.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt)
