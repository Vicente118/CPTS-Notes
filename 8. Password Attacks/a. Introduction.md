## Authentication
Authentication, at its core, is the validation of your identity by presenting a combination of four factors to a validation mechanism. They are:
1. `Something you know`: a password, passcode, pin, etc.
2. `Something you have`: an ID Card, security key, or other MFA tools
3. `Something you are`: your physical self, username, email address, or other identifiers
4. `Somewhere you are`: geolocation, IP address, etc.

## The use of passwords
The most common and widely used authentication method is still the use of passwords. But what is a password? A password or passphrase can be generally defined asÂ `a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols in a string for identity validation.`
