Passwords are commonly `hashed` when stored, in order to provide some protection in the event they fall into the hands of an attacker. `Hashing` is a mathematical function which transforms an arbitrary number of input bytes into a (typically) fixed-size output; common examples of hash functions are `MD5`, and `SHA-256`.

```shell
echo -n Soccer06! | md5sum

```

```shell
echo -n Soccer06! | sha256sum

## Rainbow tables
Rainbow tables are large pre-compiled maps of input and output values for a given hash function. These can be used to very quickly identify the password if its corresponding hash has already been mapped.
Because rainbow tables are such a powerful attack, `salting` is used. A `salt`, in cryptographic terms, is a random sequence of bytes added to a password before it is hashed. To maximize impact, salts should not be reused, e.g. for all passwords stored in one database. For example, if the salt `Th1sIsTh3S@lt_` is prepended to the same password, the MD5 hash would now be as follows:

## Brute-force attack
A `brute-force` attack involves attempting every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until the correct password is discovered. Obviously, this can take a very long time—especially for long passwords—however shorter passwords (<9 characters) are viable targets, even on consumer hardware. Brute-forcing is the only password cracking technique that is `100% effective` - in that, given enough time, any password will be cracked with this technique.

## Dictionary attack
A `dictionary` attack, otherwise known as a `wordlist` attack, is one of the most `efficient` techniques for cracking passwords, especially when operating under time-constraints as penetration testers usually do. Rather than attempting every possible combination of characters, a list containing statistically likely passwords is used. Well-known wordlists for password cracking are [rockyou.txt](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt) and those included in [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists).
