| `broadcast`  | Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans. |
| `brute`      | Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials.                                        |

| `fuzzer`     | This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time.     |
| `intrusive`  | Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system.                                                                       |

| `vuln`       | Identification of specific vulnerabilities.                                                                                             |

#### Default Script
```shell
sudo nmap <target> -sC
```

#### Specifying Scripts
```shell
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 25 --script banner,smtp-commands
```

#### Aggressive Scan
```shell
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -A
```

#### Vulnerability Assessment
- Now let us move on to HTTP port 80 and see what information and vulnerabilities we can find using the `vuln` category from `NSE`.

```shell
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sV --script vuln
```
