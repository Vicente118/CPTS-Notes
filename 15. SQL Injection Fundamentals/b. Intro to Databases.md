## Database Management Systems
A Database Management System (DBMS) helps create, define, host, and manage databases. Various kinds of DBMS were designed over time, such as file-based, Relational DBMS (RDBMS), NoSQL, Graph based, and Key/Value stores.

There are multiple ways to interact with a DBMS, such as command-line tools, graphical interfaces, or even APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
