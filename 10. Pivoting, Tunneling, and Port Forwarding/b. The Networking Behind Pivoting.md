## IP Addressing & NICs
Whether assigned `dynamically` or `statically`, the IP address is assigned to a `Network Interface Controller` (`NIC`). Commonly, the NIC is referred to as a `Network Interface Card` or `Network Adapter`. A computer can have multiple NICs (physical and virtual), meaning it can have multiple IP addresses assigned, allowing it to communicate on various networks.

## Subnet
Every IPv4 address will have a corresponding `subnet mask`. If an IP address is like a phone number, the subnet mask is like the area code. Remember that the subnet mask defines the `network` & `host` portion of an IP address. When network traffic is destined for an IP address located in a different network, the computer will send the traffic to its assigned `default gateway`. The default gateway is usually the IP address assigned to a NIC on an appliance acting as the router for a given LAN. In the context of pivoting, we need to be mindful of what networks a host we land on can reach, so documenting as much IP addressing information as possible on an engagement can prove helpful.

## Routing
#### Routing Table on Pwnbox
```shell
> netstat -r

Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
default         178.62.64.1     0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0
10.10.10.0      10.10.14.1      255.255.254.0   UG        0 0          0 tun0
10.10.14.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.254.0   U         0 0          0 tun0
10.106.0.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.240.0   U         0 0          0 eth1
10.129.0.0      10.10.14.1      255.255.0.0     UG        0 0          0 tun0
178.62.64.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.192.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
```

We will notice that Pwnbox, Linux distros, Windows, and many other operating systems have a routing table to assist the system in making routing decisions. When a packet is created and has a destination before it leaves the computer, the routing table is used to decide where to send it. For example, if we are trying to connect to a target with the IP `10.129.10.25`, we could tell from the routing table where the packet would be sent to get there. It would be forwarded to a `Gateway` out of the corresponding NIC (`Iface`).


## Protocols, Services & Ports
`Protocols` are the rules that govern network communications. Many protocols and services have corresponding `ports` that act as identifiers. Logical ports aren't physical things we can touch or plug anything into. They are in software assigned to applications. When we see an IP address, we know it identifies a computer that may be reachable over a network. When we see an open port bound to that IP address, we know that it identifies an application we may be able to connect to. Connecting to specific ports that a device is `listening` on can often allow us to use ports & protocols that are `permitted` in the firewall to gain a foothold on the network.
